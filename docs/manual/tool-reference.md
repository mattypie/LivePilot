# Tool Reference

LivePilot gives you 467 tools that control every part of Ableton Live 12. You don't call these tools directly -- you describe what you want in plain language, and the AI picks the right tools behind the scenes. But knowing what's available helps you ask better questions and understand what's happening when the AI works on your session.

This chapter covers the most-used tools, grouped by what it does. Each entry tells you the tool name, what it does in practice, what parameters it accepts, and when you'd want it. The complete list of all 467 tools is auto-generated in the **[Tool Catalog](tool-catalog.md)**.

> **Quick reference for common values:**
>
> - **Volume:** 0.0 (silence) to 1.0 (max). 0.85 is 0 dB -- Ableton's default fader position.
> - **Pan:** -1.0 (hard left) to 1.0 (hard right). 0.0 is center.
> - **Color:** 0 to 69. Ableton has a fixed palette of 70 colors.
> - **Tempo:** 20 to 999 BPM.
> - **Time values:** Always in beats. 1.0 = one quarter note, 4.0 = one bar in 4/4.
> - **Pitch:** MIDI numbers 0-127. 60 = Middle C (C3).
> - **Velocity:** 1-127. How hard the note is hit.
> - **Probability:** 0.0 to 1.0. A Live 12 feature -- notes can play randomly based on this value.
> - **Track index:** 0-based for regular tracks. Negative for return tracks (-1 = Return A, -2 = Return B). -1000 for master track.
> - **Scene/clip index:** Also 0-based. Scene 0 is the top row, clip 0 is the first slot.

## Automation

Tools for reading, writing, and generating clip automation envelopes. The automation system combines a 16-type curve engine with 15 named production recipes and spectral-aware analysis to write musically intelligent automation.

The curve engine is pure math — no Ableton dependency. It generates normalized points (0.0–1.0) that map to any parameter: volume, pan, sends, or any device parameter with an envelope. The recipes are named presets for common techniques (dub throws, filter sweeps, sidechain pumps) so you don't have to calculate breakpoints by hand.

### get_clip_automation

Lists all automation envelopes on a session clip. Shows parameter name, type (mixer/send/device), device name, and indices.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `track_index` | int | required | Track index |
| `clip_index` | int | required | Clip slot index |

**When to use:** Before writing automation — see what's already there. After clearing — verify it's clean.

### set_clip_automation

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `track_index` | int | required | Track index |

### set_arrangement_automation_via_session_record

**[v1.17+]** Writes track-level arrangement automation at a specific beat using the session-clip + arrangement-record workaround. The Live LOM forbids direct track-level arrangement automation writes outside of clips, so this tool uses a two-phase protocol: creates a session clip with the automation, arms the track, records it into arrangement at `target_beat`, then cleans up.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `track_index` | int | *(required)* | Regular track (not return) |
| `parameter_type` | string | *(required)* | `volume`, `panning`, `send`, or `device` |

| `cleanup_session_clip` | bool | `true` | Delete the temp session clip after recording |

Wall time ≈ `duration_beats × 60/tempo + 0.5s` handler overhead. Returns `{ok, tempo, slept_sec, start, complete}` with the new arrangement-clip's index on success.

**When to use:** "Automate the filter cutoff on track 2 between bar 17 and bar 25" — use when `set_arrangement_automation` (clip-scoped) isn't flexible enough because the automation needs to span dead space between clips.

## Memory

Tools for saving, searching, and replaying production techniques. The memory system lets you build a persistent library of beats, device chains, mixing setups, and production preferences — each annotated with a rich stylistic analysis the agent writes at save time. See the README's "Train Your Own AI Producer" section for how this shapes the agent over time.

## Analyzer

The Analyzer domain (38 tools) requires the LivePilot Analyzer Max for Live device on the master track.

### get_master_spectrum

Returns 9-band spectral analysis of the master output (sub_low, sub, low, low-mid, mid, high-mid, high, presence, air).

| `force` | bool | `false` | Rescan even if a recent atlas exists |
| `max_per_category` | int | 5000 | Per-category ceiling (guard against pathological library sizes) |

**When to use:** After installing a new pack, or if you suspect devices are missing from search results.

---

### reload_atlas

Force the atlas to re-read `device_atlas.json` from disk. Useful after an out-of-band edit.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| *(none)* | | | |

**When to use:** Rarely — scan_full_library handles reload internally. Manual use: after editing the JSON directly.

---

### `atlas_explore`

**[v1.25.0+]** Refined per-role candidate query callable mid-design. Wraps `AtlasResolver.resolve_for_role` with corpus-deep ranking signals: tag/genre match, signature_techniques mood overlap, curated `.adg` boost, recent positive preference, §1 banned-default penalty for melodic roles, opaque-M4L pad penalty, anti-repeat penalty, and caller avoid-list. Returns 3-5 ranked candidates with reasoning trails and a cohort_hint.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `role` | string | *(required)* | Instrument role (e.g., `"bass"`, `"pad"`, `"lead"`). |
| `mood` | string | *(required)* | Mood descriptor for ranking. |
| `genre` | string | *(required)* | Genre for tag/genre match scoring. |
| `artists` | list[str] | `[]` | Optional artist references for character alignment. |
| `n` | int | 5 | Number of candidates to return (3–10). |
| `avoid_uris` | list[str] | `[]` | URIs already in the current plan — penalized. |
| `cohort_constraint` | string | `""` | Restrict to a specific pack or cohort. |

**When to use:** During compose plan design when you need a ranked shortlist for a specific role. Call BEFORE committing to a URI — use `atlas_explore` instead of `atlas_search` when you have a role+mood+genre context.

---

### `atlas_audition`

**[v1.25.0+]** Full sidecar dump for a single URI — character_tags, signature_techniques (joined from `device_techniques_index.json`), producer-curated macro names (joined via `preset_resolver`), and curated `.adg` paths.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `uri` | string | *(required)* | Atlas URI of the device/preset to inspect. |

**When to use:** When a candidate's tags alone aren't enough to decide. Call `atlas_audition` on the top 1-2 candidates from `atlas_explore` before committing. Especially useful for verifying `signature_techniques` alignment and macro names.

---

### `atlas_substitute`

**[v1.25.0+]** Anti-tag-driven swap — finds replacement candidates after `analyze_sound_design` or `analyze_mix` flags an issue with the current device. Substring-matches `anti_tag` against the 11-key inversion map (bright/harsh/aggressive/sparse/thin/muddy/clean/dark/warm/static/generic) to derive excluded_tags + preferred_tags, filters role-mate candidates, and ranks survivors.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `current_uri` | string | *(required)* | URI of the device to replace. |
| `anti_tag` | string | *(required)* | Problem tag from analyzer output (e.g., `"harsh"`, `"muddy"`, `"generic"`). |
| `n` | int | 3 | Number of replacement candidates to return. |

**When to use:** After an analysis tool flags a problem with a device's character (e.g., "too harsh", "too generic"). Call with the flagged tag to get role-aware replacements that avoid the problem characteristic.

---

### `extension_atlas_search`

**[v1.23.0+]** Search user-local atlas overlays installed under `~/.livepilot/atlas-overlays/`. Use this for content from extension namespaces (e.g., `elektron`, `prophet`) — NOT for the main Ableton device atlas (use `atlas_search` for that).

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `query` | string | *(required)* | Case-insensitive substring; matches against `entity_id` (highest weight), `name`, `tags`/`artists`, `description` (lowest weight). |
| `namespace` | string | `""` | Restrict to one namespace. Empty = search all. |
| `entity_type` | string | `""` | Restrict to one entity_type (`signature_chain`, `machine`, `aesthetic_lineage`, `technique`). Empty = search all. |
| `limit` | int | 10 | Maximum results. |

Returns `{ query, namespace, entity_type, count, results: [...] }`.

**When to use:** After installing a community-authored extension pack, surface signature chains / machines / techniques from that namespace. The bundled atlas is for Ableton-only content — extensions cover hardware (Elektron, Prophet, etc.) and artist-specific recipes.

---

### `extension_atlas_get`

**[v1.23.0+]** Fetch a single overlay entry by namespace + entity_id, returning the full entry including its YAML body.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `namespace` | string | *(required)* | Overlay namespace (e.g., `"elektron"`). |
| `entity_id` | string | *(required)* | Entry id within the namespace. |

Returns the full entry dict, or `{ error, suggestion }` if not found. Includes any `requires_firmware` field — surface this to the user before recommending the entry.

---

### `extension_atlas_list`

**[v1.23.0+]** Enumerate user-local overlay namespaces and their entity_type counts.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `namespace` | string | `""` | Return entity_types in just this namespace. Empty = list all namespaces. |

Returns: with no namespace, `{ namespaces, counts }`; with a namespace, `{ namespace, entity_types }`.

---

## Sample Engine & Splice

LivePilot's sample system is a 3-source intelligence layer — Splice catalog (via local gRPC to the desktop app, plus HTTPS to `surfaces-graphql.splice.com` for describe + variations), Ableton browser, and filesystem. The describe-a-sound + variations tools were captured + wired 2026-04-22 via mitmproxy against Splice desktop v5.4.9.

### search_samples

Multi-source sample search — finds samples in your Ableton library, Splice catalog, and local filesystem in one call.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `query` | string | *(required)* | Keyword or phrase |
| `sources` | list | all | Subset of `["splice", "browser", "filesystem"]` |
| `limit` | int | 20 | Max results |
| `bpm` | int | — | Optional BPM filter |
| `key` | string | — | Optional musical key |

**When to use:** "Find me a kick at 128 BPM" or "any dub techno loops in A minor?"

---

### splice_describe_sound

**[v1.17+ LIVE]** Natural-language sample search — Splice's "Describe a Sound". Free-form prompts like "dark ambient pad with shimmer" or "tight 90s house hi-hat" are matched against the Splice catalog via the `SamplesSearch` GraphQL operation with `semantic=1` + `rephrase=true`.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `description` | string | *(required)* | Free-text prompt |
| `bpm` | int | — | Optional BPM filter |
| `key` | string | — | Optional musical key |
| `limit` | int | 20 | Max results |
| `rephrase` | bool | `true` | Let Splice's ML rephrase the query — returned as `rephrased_query_string` |

Returns `{samples[], total_hits, rephrased_query_string, tag_summary[]}`. Each sample has uuid/name/bpm/key/duration/tags/pack_name/files. Pair with `splice_download_sample(uuid)` to pull the audio.

**When to use:** "Get me a warm dub techno chord stab" — the AI can discover samples by vibe, not just keywords.

---

### splice_generate_variation

**[v1.17+ LIVE]** Find catalog samples similar to a given sample — Splice's "Variations" feature. Signature changed in v1.17: now takes a sample `uuid` instead of the prior `(file_hash, target_key, target_bpm, count)` speculation. Semantically this is a recommender lookup, not AI audio synthesis; up to 10 similar catalog samples are returned.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `uuid` | string | *(required)* | Source sample's catalog uuid (from describe_sound / search results) |
| `is_legacy` | bool | `true` | Match Splice client's default — leave as-is for mainstream catalog |

Returns `{similar_samples[], count}` — each entry has the same flat shape as a describe_sound result.

**When to use:** After finding one good sample, "find me more like this."

---

### splice_preview_sample

Audition a Splice sample without spending a credit — fetches the preview MP3 URL.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `uuid` or `file_hash` | string | *(required)* | Sample identifier |

**When to use:** Before committing a credit on `splice_download_sample`.

---

### splice_download_sample

Downloads a Splice sample to local disk. Credit/quota aware: on Ableton Live plans uses daily quota (100/day); on other plans uses monthly credits with a `CREDIT_HARD_FLOOR=5` safety.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `uuid` or `file_hash` | string | *(required)* | Sample identifier |
| `target_path` | string | — | Optional destination |

**When to use:** After `splice_preview_sample` confirms the sample is the right fit.

---

### splice_pack_info

Returns pack metadata by UUID. Works for owned packs (user has engaged with them) — discoverable via `splice_list_collections` + `ListSamplePacks` pagination.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `uuid` | string | *(required)* | Pack uuid (canonical 36 or extended 43 format) |

**When to use:** "Tell me about the pack this sample came from."

---

### splice_http_diagnose

**[v1.17+]** Diagnose the Splice HTTPS bridge: reports per-endpoint verified status, session-token availability, and actionable next-steps for any unverified endpoints.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| *(none)* | | | |

Returns `{verified: {describe, variation}, session_token_available, next_steps[]}`.

**When to use:** When `splice_describe_sound` or `splice_generate_variation` returns an error — diagnose first.

---

### get_splice_credits

Reports user's current Splice plan + credit/quota balance.

**When to use:** "How many credits do I have?" or before bulk-downloading.

---

### splice_list_collections / splice_search_in_collection / splice_create_collection / splice_add_to_collection / splice_remove_from_collection

Collections API — manages your Splice saved-sample folders (Likes, bass, keys, etc.).

---

### splice_list_presets / splice_preset_info / splice_download_preset

Purchased instrument preset workflows.

---

### splice_catalog_hunt

Rapid catalog exploration — batched sample search with fitness-critic ranking.

---

## Diagnostics

Session-wide health verification added late 2026-04 to catch silent-device failures (the "Simpler Snap bug" class: track meter reads normal, master reads silence).

### verify_device_alive

**[v1.16+]** Fires a test MIDI note at a specific device and measures whether it produces audible output via meter sampling. Proves the device is actually playing, not silently stuck.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `track_index` | int | *(required)* | Track holding the device |
| `device_index` | int | *(required)* | Device position in chain |
| `fire_test_note` | bool | `true` | Actually play a note (vs just checking parameter_count) |
| `test_note` | int | 60 | MIDI note to fire |
| `threshold` | float | 0.005 | Minimum peak level to consider "alive" |

**When to use:** After loading any instrument, especially Simplers — catches the Snap-ON silent-load and other stuck states.

---

### verify_all_devices_health

**[v1.16+]** Session-wide version of verify_device_alive. Fires test notes on every eligible track and reports alive / dead / skipped.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `test_midi_note` | int | 60 | MIDI note to use |
| `skip_audio_tracks` | bool | `true` | Audio tracks can't be MIDI-tested |
| `skip_empty_tracks` | bool | `true` | Skip tracks with no devices |
| `threshold` | float | 0.005 | Minimum peak level |

**When to use:** Before committing a mix, or when "something's silent and I don't know what."

---

### verify_device_health

Lightweight health check — parameter_count sanity (≤1 parameter = probably dead plugin).

**When to use:** After `load_browser_item` — cheap sanity check before spending tools on a broken plugin.

---
