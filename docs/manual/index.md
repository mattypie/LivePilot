## What LivePilot Is

LivePilot is not a tool collection with an AI wrapper. It is a **production system** — three perception layers feed into 467 tools, which are orchestrated by a dozen creative engines that understand song identity, learn your taste, diagnose session problems, and generate real musical options.

The difference: a tool collection executes "set volume to -6dB." LivePilot understands that turning down the drums might kill the groove that defines the track, suggests three genuinely different ways to create space instead, lets you preview each one, and remembers which approach you preferred.

```

The **atlas** resolves device names and browser URIs — the AI never hallucinates a preset. 641 devices are indexed by pack (Core Library + explicit-pack assignments) so "what's in Drone Lab?" is an instant lookup. Reverse-index `device_techniques_index.json` cross-references 146 techniques across 58 devices (the `atlas_techniques_for_device` tool).
The **user corpus** (v1.23.4+) extends the atlas with whatever's installed on YOUR machine — third-party plugins, custom Max devices, your `.adg` racks. Loaded by every reasoning tool with a 50/50 result-budget split alongside the factory atlas, so "sound like Burial" can route to *your* CHOWTapeModel + Splice PHOTEK pack instead of just Ableton's stock saturator. See [User Corpus Guide](../USER_CORPUS_GUIDE.md).
The **analyzer** feeds back spectral data from the master bus so the AI hears its own changes — **9 frequency bands** (sub_low / sub / low / low_mid / mid / high_mid / high / presence / air); the sub_low band (20-60 Hz) separates kick fundamental from DC rumble. From v1.20.3 the analyzer is auto-loaded via `ensure_analyzer_on_master` — the Creative Director skill calls this at the top of every turn's Phase 1 ground read.
The **memory** persists production decisions across sessions as searchable, replayable data structures.

All 467 tools execute as deterministic LOM calls on Ableton's main thread. Live-session mutations (clips, devices, mixer, arrangement) route through Ableton's undo stack; side effects that touch state outside the Live project — Splice downloads, memory/ledger writes, installer actions, atlas scans, filesystem writes — persist beyond undo.

## The Four Layers

### Layer 1: Deterministic Tools

The foundation. Direct control over every aspect of Ableton Live through the Live Object Model: transport, tracks, clips, notes, devices, scenes, mixing, arrangement, browser, automation, scales, grooves, take-lanes, follow actions, MIDI tool generators. Also includes music theory (Krumhansl-Schmuckler key detection, neo-Riemannian harmony, species counterpoint), generative algorithms (Euclidean rhythm, tintinnabuli, phase shift, additive process), and MIDI I/O.

These tools do exactly what you ask. No interpretation, no judgment. They are the building blocks.

### Layer 2: Perception

The M4L Analyzer on the master track gives LivePilot ears: 9-band FFT spectrum (v1.17+), true RMS/peak metering, Krumhansl-Schmuckler key detection, pitch tracking, FluCoMa mel-spectrum + chroma + onset detection + spectral shape. Plus deep LOM access for hidden parameters, automation state, Simpler internals, and warp markers. Offline perception adds loudness analysis (integrated LUFS, LRA), spectral analysis, and reference comparison.

Perception closes the feedback loop. Without it, the AI is blind to the result of its own changes. With it, the AI can verify that a mix move actually reduced masking, that a filter sweep landed at the right frequency, that the overall loudness is broadcast-ready.

### Layer 3: Creative Intelligence

Sits on top of the tools and perception, adding musical judgment. This is what makes LivePilot agentic:

**Understanding the song:**
- **SongBrain** builds a real-time model of identity, sacred elements, section purposes, and energy arc
- **Composition Engine** detects motifs, infers emotional arcs, plans structural moves
- **Hook Hunter** finds the most salient musical idea and tracks whether it's being developed or neglected

**Understanding the producer:**
- **Taste Graph / Agent OS** learns move family preferences, device affinities, novelty tolerance, and dimension avoidances across sessions
- **Session Continuity** tracks creative threads, turn resolutions, and the session story
- **Technique Memory** stores and recalls production decisions by mood, genre, and texture

**Making musical decisions:**
- **Semantic Moves** express high-level intent ("add contrast," "tighten the low end") as executable tool sequences with risk levels and protection thresholds
- **Wonder Mode** diagnoses stuck sessions, generates genuinely distinct rescue options, and lets you preview before committing
- **Preview Studio** renders variants using Ableton's undo system — hear each option, compare, then choose
- **Creative Constraints** activate style gates and render reference-inspired variants

**Evaluating results:**
- **Mix Engine** runs critic-driven analysis — masking, headroom, stereo, dynamics — and plans corrective moves
- **Sound Design Engine** analyzes patches for static timbre, missing modulation, and weak transients
- **Synthesis Brain** extracts timbre fingerprints + proposes synth branches
- **Transition / Reference / Translation Engines** score transitions, distill principles from reference tracks, translate across domains
- **Evaluation Loop** enforces measure-before, act, measure-after discipline on every creative move

### Layer 4: Personal Library Awareness `[v1.23.4+]`

The first three layers operate on Ableton's shipped library. Layer 4 makes the brain aware of *your specific machine* — every third-party plugin, every Max for Live device, every custom rack you've saved.

**Why this layer exists.** Most music AI tools have a fixed knowledge cutoff. LivePilot's first three layers give it generalized musical judgment, but until v1.23.4 they could only reach for Ableton-shipped gear. If you spent $500 on Valhalla plugins, $200 on a Cem Olcay MIDI suite, and built a personal library of `.adg` racks, none of that was visible to the brain. Same query → same Ableton-stock recommendation, regardless of what's actually on your hard drive.

**What it does.** The User Corpus runs a 4-phase pipeline (DETECT → CANONICALIZE → RESEARCH → SYNTHESIZE) that turns the contents of your filesystem into AI-queryable knowledge:

| Phase | Tool | What it produces |
|-------|------|------------------|
| 1. Detect | `corpus_detect_plugins` | Inventory of installed VST3/AU/AUv3/VST2/AAX/CLAP/LV2 plugins. Path-walks `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/{VST3,Components}` + runs `auval -a` for AUv3/Mac Catalyst coverage |
| 2. Canonicalize | `corpus_canonicalize_plugins` | Dedupes by vendor+name, prefers VST3 over AU, strips vendor suffix variants ("Valhalla DSP, LLC" = "Valhalladsp" = "Valhalla DSP") |
| 2.5. Cluster | `corpus_cluster_plugins` | Groups by vendor for batched research dispatch — vendors with ≥2 plugins share one WebSearch |
| 3. Research | `corpus_research_targets` | Emits a structured WebSearch task packet the agent fulfills |
| 4. Synthesize | `corpus_emit_synthesis_briefs` | Sonnet-subagent dispatch — writes per-plugin `identity.yaml` with sonic_fingerprint / reach_for / avoid / key_techniques / parameter_glossary / genre_affinity / producer_anchors |

**How it integrates with the brain.** The output overlays land at `~/.livepilot/atlas-overlays/<namespace>/` across four namespaces (`user/` for plugins, `m4l-devices/` for Max devices, `packs/` for factory + custom packs, `elektron/` for hardware). Every reasoning tool — `atlas_search`, `atlas_chain_suggest`, `atlas_macro_fingerprint`, `atlas_describe_chain` — consults the overlay alongside the factory atlas with a 50/50 result-budget split. Each result is tagged `source: factory_atlas | user_overlay:<namespace>`, so the agent always knows whether a recommendation is Ableton stock or yours.

**The versatility argument in one example.** A new user asks "make me a J Dilla beat":

| Without User Corpus | With User Corpus |
|---|---|
| Operator FM marimba (default preset) | Koala Sampler (your SP-404 emulator) |
| Live's stock Drum Rack samples | Splice PHOTEK Vol.1 pack you bought |
| Saturator (Tape mode) for warmth | CHOWTapeModel (your peer-reviewed tape model) |
| Operator-based bass (default) | Moog Model D (your subby analog bass) |

Same query, different brain. The closer the brain matches *your* library, the more useful every recommendation becomes.

**Quick start.** From any MCP client:

```
corpus_setup_wizard           # one-shot — runs the full pipeline
# OR fine-grained:
corpus_detect_plugins use_auval=true
corpus_canonicalize_plugins
corpus_cluster_plugins
corpus_research_targets
corpus_emit_synthesis_briefs
```
