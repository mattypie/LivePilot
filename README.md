## What LivePilot Does

Most MCP servers are tool collections — they execute commands. LivePilot is an **agentic production system**. It has eight layers that work together:

| Layer | What it provides |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Deterministic Tools** | Direct control: transport, tracks, clips, notes, devices, scenes, mixing, arrangement, browser, automation |
| **Device Atlas** | Knowledge of every device in Ableton's library — 5264 devices indexed 7 ways (by_id, by_name, by_uri, by_category, by_tag, by_genre, by_pack). 120 enriched with YAML sonic intelligence (47 with aesthetic-tagged `signature_techniques`). 683 drum kits mapped. Free-text `atlas_describe_chain` ("a granular pad like Tim Hecker") and reverse-lookup `atlas_techniques_for_device` cross-reference 146 techniques across 58 devices |
| **User Corpus** `[v1.23.4+]` | Detects YOUR third-party plugins (VST3 / AU / AUv3 / VST2 / AAX / CLAP / LV2) via filesystem walk + `auval -a`, then auto-synthesizes per-plugin identity profiles (sonic_fingerprint, reach_for, avoid, key_techniques) into the same overlay system the factory atlas uses. The brain stops being limited to Ableton's shipped devices and learns *your* library — Valhalla, Glitchmachines, Cem Olcay, ChowDSP, Moog, your custom .adg racks, your Max for Live devices. Same query → different recommendations per user. **14 `corpus_*` tools.** See [User Corpus](#user-corpus--14-tools-v1234) below |
| **Concept Surface** | Two reference files let the LLM's training translate into LivePilot: `artist-vocabularies.md` maps ~25 producers (Villalobos, Hawtin, Basic Channel, Gas, Basinski, Hecker, Aphex, Autechre, Dilla, Burial, Henke, Daft Punk, …) to `reach_for` / `avoid` / `key_techniques`; `genre-vocabularies.md` maps 15 genres to tempo / kick / bass / percussion / harmonic / texture / devices. The LLM reads "sound like Gas" and gets a concrete device chain, not guesswork |
| **Sample Engine** | Three-source sample intelligence — Ableton's browser, your filesystem, and Splice's catalog (plan-aware: Ableton Live plan uses daily quota, Sounds+/Creator uses credits, free samples bypass both). 6 fitness critics. 29 processing techniques. Collections, presets, preview-URL audition, LIVE Describe-a-Sound + Variations via Splice GraphQL |
| **Spectral Perception** | Real-time ears via M4L — 9-band FFT (with sub_low split at 20-60 Hz for kick fundamentals), RMS/peak metering, Krumhansl-Schmuckler key detection, pitch tracking, FluCoMa mel/chroma/onset. Auto-loaded via `ensure_analyzer_on_master` (v1.20.3) — no more silently-degraded mix moves from forgotten analyzer |
| **Technique Memory** | Persistent library of production decisions. Save a beat pattern, device chain, or mix template. Recall by mood, genre, or texture across sessions |
| **Creative Intelligence** | 12 engines on top of the tools: SongBrain, Taste Graph, Wonder Mode, Mix/Sound-Design/Transition/Reference/Translation engines, Hook Hunter, Stuckness Detector, Session Continuity, Preview Studio. **44 semantic moves** (v1.26) — musical intents like "tighten the low end" or "make kick and bass lock" that compile into tool sequences with risk levels and target dimensions |

## Two Ways to Talk to LivePilot

Pick whichever is faster for the idea in your head — both reach the same 467-tool surface.

### Route A — Artist / aesthetic shorthand

> *"Sound like J Dilla."* &nbsp; *"Make this feel more like Burial."* &nbsp; *"BoC-style pads."*

The Concept Surface (`artist-vocabularies.md` + `genre-vocabularies.md`) maps ~25 producers and 15 genres to concrete `reach_for` / `avoid` / `key_techniques` lists. An artist name becomes a queryable label for a cluster of techniques. Useful when you know the aesthetic but not the parameters, or when one word is faster than the half-paragraph of reverb / sidechain / pitch-bend settings it implies.

### Route B — Direct musical intent

> *"Humanize the drum loop: 62% swing on the 16th hats, snare landing 4 ms ahead of the 2 and 4 for forward push, ghost snares filling every off-16th at velocity 25–40, kick locked to the grid, and add ±2 ms timing jitter to everything except the kick. EQ a 3 dB notch at 380 Hz on the snare to pull it back from the bass."*

The full Live Object Model is exposed. Swing percentages, micro-timing offsets in milliseconds, dB cuts, frequency ranges, modulation depths, envelope shapes, send levels, automation curves, scale degrees, voice leading — anything the LOM allows, plus the 44 semantic moves on top.

### Mixing the routes

Most sessions do both. Lead with shorthand to anchor the aesthetic, then refine with millisecond-precision intent once the shape is roughed in. Every artist tag resolves to moves you can also call directly — the shorthand is a convenience layer over the same parameters you reach with Route B.

### How the pieces connect

**Remote Script** (`remote_script/LivePilot/`) — A Python ControlSurface that runs inside Ableton's process. Listens on TCP 9878. All Live Object Model calls execute on Ableton's main thread via `schedule_message`. Detects Ableton version at startup and enables four capability tiers: Core (12.0+), Enhanced Arrangement (12.1.10+), Full Intelligence (12.3+), Collaborative (12.4+).

**MCP Server** (`mcp_server/`) — Python FastMCP server. Validates inputs, routes commands to the Remote Script over TCP, manages the M4L bridge, runs the atlas, sample engine, composer, and all intelligence engines. This is what your AI client connects to.

**M4L Bridge** (`m4l_device/`) — Optional Max for Live Audio Effect on the master track. Provides deep LOM access through Max's LiveAPI that the ControlSurface API can't reach. UDP 9880 (M4L to server) carries spectral data and LiveAPI responses. OSC 9881 (server to M4L) sends commands. The 38 spectral/analyzer tools strictly require the bridge; device and sample tools that call the bridge also have graceful fallbacks, so core functionality works without it. Backed by 32 bridge commands for hidden parameters, Simpler internals, warp markers, display values, and Simpler warp / Compressor sidechain writes that live on child objects Python can't reach.

**Device Atlas** (`mcp_server/atlas/`) — In-memory indexed JSON database. 5264 devices with browser URIs (bundled baseline), 120 enriched with YAML sonic intelligence profiles (mood, genre, texture, recommended chains). 7 indexes: by_id, by_name, by_uri, by_category, by_tag, by_genre, by_pack. Reverse-index `device_techniques_index.json` powers `atlas_techniques_for_device` (146 cross-references across 58 devices). The AI never hallucinates a device name or preset — it always resolves against the atlas first. **v1.22.0+**: run `scan_full_library` after install to index YOUR packs + User Library + plugins into `~/.livepilot/atlas/device_atlas.json` — your personal atlas overrides the baseline and survives npm updates.

**Sample Engine** (`mcp_server/sample_engine/`) — Searches three sources simultaneously: BrowserSource (Ableton's library), SpliceSource (local Splice catalog via SQLite), FilesystemSource (user directories). Every result passes through a 6-critic fitness battery (key, tempo, spectral, genre, mood, technical). 29 processing techniques (Surgeon precision vs. Alchemist experimentation). Builds complete sample processing plans with warp, slice, and effect recommendations.

**Splice Client** (`mcp_server/splice_client/`) — Searches Splice's catalog through two layers: the local SQLite database (`sounds.db`, already-downloaded samples) and the live gRPC API (full catalog, including samples you haven't downloaded yet). The gRPC client auto-detects Splice's dynamic port via `port.conf`, handles self-signed TLS, and enforces a 5-credit safety floor before any download. Per-call timeouts (5–10s) prevent a hung Splice process from stalling the MCP event loop. Graceful fallback to SQL-only if grpcio isn't installed. No API key needed — authentication comes from the running Splice desktop app.

**Composer** (`mcp_server/composer/`) — Prompt-to-plan pipeline. Parses natural language ("dark minimal techno 128bpm with industrial textures") into a CompositionIntent (genre, mood, tempo, key). Plans layers using role templates (kick, bass, percussion, texture, lead, pad, fx). Compiles to a step-by-step plan of tool calls that the agent executes. Does not execute autonomously — returns the plan. 4 genre defaults (house, techno, trap, ambient) — genres outside this set fall back to a neutral layer plan.

**Corpus** (`mcp_server/corpus/`) — Parsed device-knowledge markdown converted to queryable Python structures: EmotionalRecipe, GenreChain, PhysicalModelRecipe, AutomationGesture. Feeds Wonder Mode, Sound Design critics, and the Composer with deep creative knowledge at runtime — not just LLM prompts, actual structured data.

**Execution Router** (`mcp_server/runtime/execution_router.py`) — Classifies each step in a multi-step plan as remote_command (TCP to Ableton), bridge_command (OSC to M4L), or mcp_tool (internal), then dispatches it through the correct channel.

## The Intelligence Layer

12 engines sit on top of the 467 tools. They give the AI musical judgment, not just musical execution.

### SongBrain — What the Song Is

Builds a real-time model of the session: identity core (what defines this track), sacred elements (what must not be casually damaged), section purposes (what each part is doing emotionally), energy arc (where the song is heading). Detects identity drift when edits pull the track away from what made it work.

### Taste Graph — What You Like

Learns your production preferences across sessions. Tracks which move families you keep vs. undo, which devices you gravitate toward, how experimental you want suggestions (novelty band), and which dimensions you avoid. Every accept/reject updates the graph. Two producers using the same tools get different recommendations.

### Semantic Moves — Musical Actions, Not Parameters

**44 high-level intents** across 7 families (mix, arrangement, transition, sound_design, performance, device_creation, sample) — "add contrast," "tighten the low end," "make kick and bass lock," "sample vocal ghost," "destroy then rebuild." Each move compiles into a concrete tool sequence with risk level, target dimensions, and protection thresholds. Analyzer-gated moves (`tighten_low_end`, `make_kick_bass_lock`) mark their spectrum pre-reads as optional so the plan continues even when the analyzer isn't available. The AI knows what it's risking with every action.

### Wonder Mode — Stuck-Rescue Workflow

When a session is stuck — repeated undos, overpolished loops, no structural progress — Wonder Mode activates:

1. **Diagnose** — classify the stuckness (loop trap? missing contrast? identity unclear?)
2. **Generate** — find semantic moves that address the diagnosis, enforcing real distinctness
3. **Preview** — apply each variant, capture, undo. Hear before committing
4. **Commit or Reject** — choice recorded into taste and session continuity

### Creative Engines

| Engine | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mix Engine** | Critic-driven analysis: masking, headroom, stereo, dynamics. Plans corrective moves with before/after evaluation |
| **Sound Design Engine** | Analyzes patches for static timbre, missing modulation, weak transients. Suggests parameter moves |
| **Transition Engine** | Classifies transition types (drop, build, breakdown). Scores quality, plans improvements from archetypes |
| **Composition Engine** | Section analysis, motif detection, emotional arcs. Plans structural moves |
| **Performance Engine** | Safety-constrained suggestions for live sets. Knows which moves risk audio dropouts |
| **Reference Engine** | Distills principles from reference tracks. Maps them to your session as concrete moves |

### Hook Hunter

Identifies the most salient musical idea — ranks candidates by recurrence across scenes, motif salience, and section placement (payoff-section boost). Tracks whether hooks are developed, neglected, or undermined, and flags when a transition fails to deliver expected payoff. Rhythm-side ranking is currently heuristic (drum-track detection + clip reuse); true onset-based rhythmic features are on the roadmap.

### Session Continuity

Maintains creative threads ("the chorus needs more lift") and turn resolutions across the session. When you return to a project: *"Last time, you kept the filter sweep for the bridge. The chorus lift thread is still open."*

### Evaluation Loop

Every engine follows: **measure before → act → measure after → compare**. If a change made things worse (more masking, lost headroom, identity drift), the system flags it before you move on.

<br>

### M4L Bridge — 38 analyzer tools `[optional]`, 32 bridge commands

The M4L Analyzer sits on the master track. UDP 9880 carries spectral data to the server. OSC 9881 sends commands back. The `ensure_analyzer_on_master` pre-flight (v1.20.3) loads the analyzer idempotently on first use — call it once at session start and forget about it.

> [!TIP]
> Most tools work without the analyzer — it adds 38 spectral/analyzer tools (frequency, loudness, perception, Simpler, warp) and closes the feedback loop.

```
SPECTRAL ─────── 9-band frequency decomposition (sub_low → air)
                 sub_low (20-60 Hz) split off so kick fundamentals don't hide inside sub
                 true RMS / peak metering
                 Krumhansl-Schmuckler key detection

DEEP LOM ─────── hidden parameters beyond ControlSurface API
                 automation state per parameter
                 recursive device tree (6 levels into nested racks)
                 human-readable display values as shown in Live's UI

SIMPLER ──────── replace / load samples
                 get slice points, crop, reverse
                 warp to N beats, get audio file paths

WARP ─────────── get / add / move / remove markers
                 tempo manipulation at the sample level
```

**v1.23.0 — User-local extensions:** Drop YAML files at `~/.livepilot/atlas-overlays/<namespace>/` to extend the atlas with custom hardware libraries, signature chains, or technique recipes — survives npm updates. See [`docs/EXTENSION_API.md`](docs/EXTENSION_API.md).

**v1.23.4 — Pack-Atlas Phases C/D/E/F:** Six new corpus-driven orchestration tools turn the 3,917 parsed pack sidecars + 104 demo `.als` parses into actionable artifacts — find similar presets, transplant aesthetics across BPM/scale/genre, narrate a demo, extract a track's chain as a runnable plan, bootstrap pack-coherent compositions, run any of 15 cross-pack workflow recipes. All execution is dry-run by default — returns plans, doesn't auto-mutate the session.

### User Corpus — 14 tools `[v1.23.4+]`

> **Why this exists.** The factory atlas (5264 devices, 33 packs) is what *Ableton ships*. Your real library is bigger — your VST/AU plugins, your Max for Live devices, your `.adg` racks, your custom presets, your Splice packs. Without the corpus builder, all of that is invisible to LivePilot. With it, the same query that previously routed to Operator + Saturator can route to *your* Valhalla Supermassive, *your* CHOWTapeModel, *your* Moog Model D — because LivePilot now knows what you have, what each tool sounds like, and which producer aesthetics it supports.

The corpus builder is a 4-phase pipeline that turns "what's installed on this Mac" into AI-queryable knowledge:

```
Phase 1 — DETECT      Walk plugin folders + run `auval -a` for AUv3 / Mac Catalyst
                       coverage. Captures format (VST3/AU/AAX/CLAP/LV2),
                       vendor, version, bundle ID. ~40-200 plugins typical.

Phase 2 — CANONICALIZE Dedupe by vendor+name, prefer VST3 over AU, strip vendor
                       suffix variants ("Valhalla DSP, LLC" = "Valhalladsp" =
                       "Valhalla DSP"). Cluster by vendor for batch research.

Phase 3 — RESEARCH    Discover local manual files (PDFs, READMEs) per plugin.
                       Emit WebSearch task packets for plugin+technique research.

Phase 4 — SYNTHESIZE  Sonnet subagent dispatch — write per-plugin identity.yaml
                       with sonic_fingerprint / reach_for / avoid / key_techniques /
                       parameter_glossary / comparable_plugins / genre_affinity /
                       producer_anchors. EXACTLY ONE primary format tag (no
                       dual-indexing across formats).
```

The result lives at `~/.livepilot/atlas-overlays/user/plugins/<plugin_id>/identity.yaml` and is loaded by every reasoning tool — `atlas_search`, `atlas_chain_suggest`, `atlas_macro_fingerprint`, `atlas_describe_chain` — alongside the factory atlas. Each result is tagged with its source (`factory_atlas` vs `user_overlay:user`), so the agent always knows whether it's recommending Ableton stock or your own gear.

```
corpus_setup_wizard            One-shot orchestration — runs the full pipeline
corpus_init                    Initialize ~/.livepilot/corpus/ + manifest.yaml
corpus_status                  Inspect manifest, sources, scan history
corpus_list_scanners           Enumerate registered scanner types
corpus_add_source              Register a new scan source (project / racks / Max / samples)
corpus_remove_source           Remove a scan source from manifest
corpus_scan                    Run scanners on configured sources
corpus_detect_plugins          Phase 1 — VST3 / AU / AUv3 / VST2 / AAX / LV2 detection
corpus_canonicalize_plugins    Phase 2 — dedupe + VST3-preferred + suffix strip
corpus_cluster_plugins         Phase 2.5 — group by vendor for efficient research dispatch
corpus_trim_plugin_identity    Slim a yaml to the overlay-required minimum
corpus_discover_manuals        Phase 3 — locate local PDFs / READMEs per plugin
corpus_research_targets        Phase 3 — emit WebSearch task packet for the agent
corpus_emit_synthesis_briefs   Phase 4 — emit sonnet-subagent briefs per plugin
```

**Why versatility outside Ableton matters.** A static knowledge base ages out the day you install a new plugin. The corpus builder makes LivePilot's knowledge boundary equal to *your library*, not *Ableton's library*. Every plugin you add can be re-scanned and synthesized in minutes; every saved `.adg` rack you build can be indexed alongside Ableton's factory chains. The brain becomes specifically yours.

**Quick start (3 commands):**

```bash
# In your MCP client (Claude Code / Desktop / Cursor):
corpus_setup_wizard                              # one-shot orchestration
# OR fine-grained control:
corpus_detect_plugins use_auval=true             # finds AUv3 / Mac Catalyst plugins
corpus_canonicalize_plugins                      # VST3 preference + vendor dedup
corpus_cluster_plugins                           # vendor-grouped clusters
corpus_research_targets                          # → agent runs WebSearch
corpus_emit_synthesis_briefs                     # → sonnet writes identity.yamls
```

### Splice Integration

LivePilot reads Splice's local SQLite database to search your downloaded samples with full metadata. No API key needed — it reads the database file directly.

**What it does:**
- Searches your downloaded Splice samples with key, BPM, genre, and tag metadata
- Integrates as a third source alongside Ableton's browser and filesystem scanning
- Works without a Splice subscription — any previously downloaded samples are searchable

**How it works:** The Sample Engine's `SpliceSource` reads `~/Library/Application Support/com.splice.Splice/users/default/*/sounds.db` — Splice's local SQLite catalog of downloaded samples. Read-only, no network calls.

**Requirements:** Splice desktop app running (the MCP server talks to it over gRPC at a dynamic port advertised via `port.conf`, with self-signed TLS). For fully offline search, previously-downloaded samples are always searchable via the local SQLite fallback even if the Splice app isn't running.

<br>

### Composer — three modes (v1.25.0)

Prompt-to-plan auto-composition engine. Three modes share a common Applier substrate (preflight: bridge handshake retry + analyzer load; postflight: monitoring=Auto on new tracks + back_to_arranger). All modes return executable plans — the agent executes each step, it does not run autonomously.

```
"dark minimal techno 128bpm with industrial textures and ghostly vocals"
    │
    ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Prompt Parser   │ → CompositionIntent (genre, mood, tempo, key)
└────────┬────────┘
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Layer Planner   │ → role templates (kick, bass, perc, texture, lead, pad, fx)
└────────┬────────┘
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Plan Compiler   │ → executable tool sequences
└────────┬────────┘
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│ Execution Router │ → dispatches: create tracks, search samples, load devices,
│                  │   program notes, set volumes, build arrangement
└─────────────────┘
```

#### fast mode — `compose_fast_apply`

Quick loop sketch. Single scene in session view. Intended for roughing out ideas quickly.

- Hunt order: curated `.adg` chains from the browser first, atlas devices second, bare instruments only as last resort
- Drum-role pitch repair included (Simpler default root vs. MIDI 36 offset)
- 4 genre defaults: house, techno, trap, ambient (unknown genres fall back to a neutral layer plan)
- Invoke with: *"Make me a [genre] loop at [tempo] BPM"*

#### full mode — `compose_full_apply`

Full track with song form: intro, verse, hook, breakdown, outro. Uses a two-phase LLM-creative brief flow — the LLM authors the form (sections, track list, per-section variants); the framework supplies the vocabulary (device hunt order, MIDI generation rules, arrangement conventions).

- Per-section MIDI variants prevent repeated tiles across the arrangement
- Native arrangement clips via `create_native_arrangement_clip` (one clip per section, looped to fill section length)
- Zombie-track cleanup in postflight (removes tracks with no clips and no instrument device)
- Drum-role pitch repair ported from fast mode
- **Known gap (v1.25):** `KnowledgePack.atlas_candidates_per_role` is an empty stub — the agent currently falls through to `search_browser` filename matching instead of consulting the indexed atlas. This is BUG-FULL-MODE-24 and is the headline feature of v1.25.
- Invoke with: *"Write a full [genre] track at [tempo] BPM"* or *"Build a full arrangement"*

#### develop mode — `develop_apply`

Extends an existing 8-bar loop without disturbing the seed material.

- Introspects the existing session (classifies tracks by name and content)
- Pulls artist and stylistic references from the user prompt
- Writes per-track variants and new supporting layers alongside the seed
- Invoke with: *"Develop this loop"* or *"Extend what's here into a longer idea"*

#### KnowledgePack scaffolding (v1.25.0)

All three modes share a `KnowledgePack` that provides structured creative context at runtime:

- `event_lexicon` — 42 structural events across 7 categories (drum density, harmonic, texture, vocal, rhythm feel, tension, fx gesture)
- `genre_context` — parses the 15-genre `genre-vocabularies.md` at load time
- `artist_context` — parses the ~25-producer `artist-vocabularies.md` at load time
- `atlas_candidates_per_role` — **stubbed in v1.25.0**, will be populated in v1.25

#### Core composer tools

- `compose` — plan a multi-layer composition from text prompt (entry point, mode-agnostic)
- `compose_fast_apply` — execute fast mode directly
- `compose_full_apply` — execute full mode directly
- `develop_apply` — execute develop mode directly
- `augment_with_samples` — plan sample-based layers for an existing session
- `get_composition_plan` — dry-run preview (see the plan without credit checks)

## Install

### Easiest: Claude Desktop Extension (1 click)

Download [`livepilot.mcpb`](https://github.com/dreamrec/LivePilot/releases/latest) and double-click it.
Claude Desktop installs everything automatically. Then:

1. Open Ableton Live 12
2. Preferences → Link, Tempo & MIDI → Control Surface → **LivePilot**
3. Start chatting

> [!TIP]
> The Desktop Extension auto-installs the Remote Script and M4L Analyzer on first launch.

### Quick: One Command Setup

```bash
npx livepilot --setup
```

Runs the full setup wizard: checks Python, installs the Remote Script, creates the Python environment, copies the M4L Analyzer, and tests the Ableton connection.

### Manual: Step by Step

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Remote Script</strong></summary>

```bash
npx livepilot --install
```

Restart Ableton → Preferences → Link, Tempo & MIDI → Control Surface → **LivePilot**

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. MCP Client</strong></summary>

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude mcp add LivePilot -- npx livepilot
claude plugin add github:dreamrec/LivePilot/plugin
```

**Codex App:**
```bash
npx livepilot --install-codex-plugin
```

**Claude Desktop (macOS)** — `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "LivePilot": { "command": "npx", "args": ["livepilot"] }
  }
}
```

**Claude Desktop (Windows):**
```cmd
npm install -g livepilot
livepilot --install
```
`%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "LivePilot": { "command": "livepilot" }
  }
}
```

**Cursor** — `.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "LivePilot": { "command": "npx", "args": ["livepilot"] }
  }
}
```

**VS Code** — `.vscode/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "LivePilot": { "command": "npx", "args": ["livepilot"] }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. M4L Analyzer (optional — adds 38 tools)</strong></summary>

Drag `LivePilot_Analyzer.amxd` onto the master track for real-time spectral analysis.
The `--setup` wizard and Desktop Extension do this automatically. From v1.20.3, your AI client can also call `ensure_analyzer_on_master` — an idempotent pre-flight that loads the device if missing and no-ops otherwise. The Creative Director skill does this on every session's Phase 1 ground read so you can't forget.

> **Important:** The Analyzer must be the LAST device on the master track — after all effects (EQ, Compressor, Utility) so it reads the final output signal. The pre-flight tool reports `is_last_on_master: bool` and warns if the invariant is broken.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4. Splice (optional — adds sample catalog)</strong></summary>

If you have Splice installed with downloaded samples, the Sample Engine can search them with full metadata (key, BPM, genre, tags) via the local SQLite database.

No API key, no configuration — the Sample Engine reads Splice's `sounds.db` file directly.

Without Splice, the Sample Engine still searches Ableton's browser and your filesystem.

## Plugin

**Codex App**

```bash
npx livepilot --install-codex-plugin
```

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude plugin add github:dreamrec/LivePilot/plugin
```

| Command | What |
|---------|------|
| `/session` | Full session overview with diagnostics |
| `/beat` | Guided beat creation |
| `/arrange` | Guided arrangement and song structure |
| `/mix` | Mixing assistant |
| `/sounddesign` | Sound design workflow |
| `/perform` | Live performance mode with safety constraints |
| `/evaluate` | Before/after evaluation of recent changes |
| `/memory` | Technique library management |

**Producer Agent** — an orchestrated multi-step assistant for building,
layering and refining sessions. Consults memory for style context, searches
the atlas for instruments, searches samples, creates tracks, programs MIDI,
chains effects, reads the spectrum to verify, and arranges sections. The
agent proposes plans; the user confirms and listens. LivePilot is a high-
trust operator, not an autonomous producer.

**Core Skill** — operational discipline connecting all layers.
Consult atlas before loading. Read analyzer after mixing.
Check memory before creative decisions. Verify every mutation.
