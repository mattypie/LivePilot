# `query:Synths#<Name>` — the same scheme used for native Ableton instruments
# (Operator, Wavetable, Collision, …).  That scheme only resolves in Live's
# browser for *native* instruments; M4L pack instruments are NOT browsable under
# "Synths".  Their presets (.adg racks) ARE browsable under "sounds", so agents
# must fall back to search_browser(path="sounds", name_filter="<preset-name>").
#
# A device ID belongs here when ALL of the following hold:
#   1. Its atlas URI is `query:Synths#<Name>`
#   2. The device is an M4L / pack instrument (not a native Ableton synth engine)
#   3. load_browser_item with the Synths# URI returns INVALID_PARAM in Live
#
# Do NOT add native instruments (Operator, Wavetable, Drift, Meld, Poli, etc.)
# even if they were introduced in a later Live version — those resolve fine.
# Add only IDs that have been *confirmed* broken in a live session.

    Takes a demo project, preset chain, or workflow recipe from the Pack-Atlas
    corpus and translates it to a new musical context (different BPM, scale,
    aesthetic register).  Returns a structured plan with executable tool calls
    — agent applies the plan via load_browser_item, set_device_parameter,
    set_clip_pitch, etc.  No Live connection required; all data from local
    JSON sidecars.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source_namespace : str
        Namespace to look up the source entity.  Use "packs" for demo projects
        and Factory Pack presets; "m4l-devices" for M4L vendor devices;
        "elektron" for Elektron signature chains.

    source_entity_id : str
        Entity identifier.  For demo projects use the form "pack-slug__demo-slug"
        or "pack_slug__demo_slug" (hyphens and underscores are normalised).
        Examples: "drone_lab__earth", "drone-lab__emergent-planes",
        "mood-reel__mood-reel-demo".
        For pack presets (with source_track_or_preset): use the pack slug,
        e.g. "drone_lab".

    source_track_or_preset : str, optional
        Sub-selector within a demo or pack.  For pack presets: the preset
        file path slug such as "instruments_laboratory_razor-wire-drone"
        (underscores or hyphens both accepted).  Omit when targeting the
        whole demo project.

    target_bpm : float, optional
        Target BPM.  Pass 0.0 to keep source BPM.

    target_scale_root : int, optional
        Target scale root note as MIDI pitch-class (0=C, 1=C#, … 11=B).
        Pass -1 to keep source root.

    target_scale_name : str, optional
        Target scale mode name.  Supported: "Major", "Minor", "Dorian",
        "Phrygian", "Mixolydian", "Lydian", "Locrian".  Empty string = keep
        source mode.

    target_aesthetic : str, optional
        Free-text aesthetic descriptor.  Used to detect aesthetic-incompatible
        devices and drive REPLACE decisions.  Examples: "mood-reel cinematic",
        "inspired_by_nature tree_tone", "lo-fi dusty tape", "clean orchestral".

    preserve_macro_ratios : bool, default True
        When True, non-default macro values from the source are carried forward
        as normalised ratios [0-1] even when the target has different raw ranges.

    preserve_pitch_intervals : bool, default True
        When True, pitch interval relationships within each voice are preserved
        and only a global transposition is applied (scale shift stays parallel).

    explanation_depth : str, default "standard"
        Controls verbosity of the reasoning_artifact field.
        "terse"    — 1-2 sentence summary.
        "standard" — 1 paragraph with key decisions enumerated.
        "verbose"  — full per-decision narrative with producer-vocabulary
                     anchors where applicable.

    Returns
    -------
    dict with keys:
        source           — source musical context (bpm, scale, tracks_summary)

    customize_aesthetic : dict, optional
        Optional aesthetic-shift parameters. Supported keys:

    """v1.25 — Refined per-role atlas candidate query (hybrid surface Layer B).

    Use during compose-full plan design when the brief's `atlas_anchors`
    don't fit the section's purpose, or when you need siblings of a role
    pick that the resolver hasn't surfaced yet.

    Each candidate carries a reasoning trail describing WHY it matches
    (signature_technique mood overlap, curated .adg presence, taste profile,
    §1 banned-default penalty, anti-repeat penalty). Pick the one whose
    reasoning best matches the section's intent.

    Parameters
    ----------
    role : str
        Brief role: "kick", "snare", "hat", "perc", "bass", "lead", "pad",
        "atmos", "vocal_chop", "fx", "spectral".
    mood : str, optional
        Free-text mood — token-matched against signature_techniques for boost.
        Examples: "spectral warped", "warm dusty", "dreamy sublime".
    genre : str, optional
        Genre slug used for genre_affinity boost. Examples: "dub_techno", "ambient".
    artists : list[str], optional
        Producer references. Currently used as vocab passthrough; ranking
        integration is v1.25.x.
    n : int, default 5
        Maximum candidates to return.
    avoid_uris : list[str], optional
        URIs to exclude (already-used picks within this session/plan).
    cohort_constraint : list[str], optional
        If provided, return ONLY candidates whose pack is in this list.

    Returns
