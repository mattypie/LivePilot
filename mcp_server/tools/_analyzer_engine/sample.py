"""Simpler post-load hygiene + filename heuristics.

Extracted from ``analyzer.py`` as part of BUG-C1. Covers:

  * BPM-in-filename detection (used to tell warped loops from one-shots)
  * Post-load verification + Snap=0 + warped-loop defaults for Simpler

Context (docs/2026-04-14-bugs-discovered.md):

The M4L bridge's ``replace_simpler_sample`` command can report success
even when the sample is still the bootstrap placeholder. Simpler's
display name also doesn't refresh after a replace. After loading, the
``Snap`` parameter is ON by default which causes the Sample Start
position to snap to a location outside the new sample's valid audio —
resulting in silent playback. The hygiene here fixes both.
