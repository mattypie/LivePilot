    📌 On the `tension_curve` vs other energy metrics (BUG-B21 clarification):
      LivePilot exposes THREE intentionally different "energy-like"
      signals — they are NOT scaled versions of each other:

        1. `get_section_graph.energy` / `get_performance_state.energy_level`
           → density-based (active-track ratio per section). After the
           Batch 6 cross-engine unification these two are identical.
           Use when asking "how busy is this section?"

        2. `get_emotional_arc.tension` (this tool)
           → narrative-arc signal weighted by harmonic instability
           (derived per section from key-detection confidence — low
           confidence reads as unstable — plus a bump when the mode
           shifts from the previous section), section placement, and
           payoff/contrast. Use when asking
           "where does the song want to go emotionally?" — tension
           can be HIGH in a sparse-but-anticipatory section (low
           density) and LOW in a busy-but-resolved section (high
           density).

        3. `get_performance_state.energy_window.target_energy`
           → forward-looking — next-scene target, not current state.

      If the three readings disagree for the same section, that's the
      DESIGN: density ≠ tension ≠ intended destination. Pick the one
      that matches your question.
