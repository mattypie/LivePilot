    """Compute a project fingerprint from session info.

    v1.10.3 Truth Release: this used to use `tempo + len(tracks) + sorted
    track names`, which had obvious collisions — any two songs at the same
    tempo with the same track names collided even if the tracks were in
    different order, the scenes were different, or the arrangement length
    differed. The author's own comment acknowledged the weakness.

    The new hash uses a lot more entropy from the session:
      * tempo (1 decimal)
      * time signature (num/denom)
      * song_length (arrangement length in beats) — very distinguishing
      * ORDERED track list: (index, name, color_index, has_midi_input)
      * ORDERED scene list: (index, name, color_index)
      * return track count + names

    This is still a fingerprint, not a true project ID (for that we'd need
    the Live set file path, which requires a new Remote Script handler).
    But it's collision-resistant across the common failure modes:
      * template-based starts diverge once the user renames a track, adds
        a scene, or adjusts the arrangement length
      * track reordering produces a new hash (correctly — it's a real edit)
      * two songs at 128 BPM with tracks named Drums/Bass no longer collide
        unless they also share identical scene lists AND song length
