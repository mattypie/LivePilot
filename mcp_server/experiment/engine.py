"""Experiment engine — runs branches sequentially using Ableton's undo system.

The engine manages the lifecycle: create branches from semantic moves,
run each one (apply → capture → undo), evaluate, rank, and commit the winner.

Critical constraint: Ableton has linear undo. Experiments MUST run sequentially:
  1. Capture before state
  2. Apply semantic move (compiled plan)
  3. Capture after state
  4. Undo all changes back to the checkpoint
  5. Repeat for next branch
  6. When winner is chosen, re-apply that branch's moves permanently

All I/O happens through the AbletonConnection passed to run methods.
The engine itself is pure orchestration logic.
