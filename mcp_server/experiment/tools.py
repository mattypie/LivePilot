    6. Evaluate the branch and classify its outcome via evaluation.policy
    7. Record per-step results on branch.execution_log

    Branches run sequentially (Ableton has linear undo).

    exploration_rules: when True, branches that fail technical gates
      (score < 0.40, non-positive measurable delta) are classified as
      "interesting_but_failed" instead of "failed" — they stay in the
      experiment for audit but don't appear in the ranking. Protection
      violations STILL force undo regardless of this flag — that's a
      safety invariant, not a taste judgment.

    render_verify (PR4/v2): when True, each branch also captures audio
      before and after execution, analyzes spectrum + loudness offline,
      extracts a TimbralFingerprint, and attaches the before/after
      fingerprint + diff to the branch snapshots. The diff is fed into

      False preserves speed; opt in when you want the classifier to
      respond to spectral movement, not just track-meter drops.

    render_duration_seconds: capture length per snapshot when
      render_verify is on. Default 2.0 seconds. Each branch adds
      ~2 * duration_seconds of capture time plus ~1-2s of offline
      analysis — a 3-branch experiment at 2s adds ~15-18s.
