"""Unified async execution router for compiled plan steps.

Classifies each step by backend (remote_command, mcp_tool, bridge_command)
and dispatches through the correct transport. Async-only — there is no
sync path. Callers that need to execute plans live inside an async tool
and await execute_plan_steps_async.

Step backends:
  remote_command — valid Remote Script handler, goes through the sync TCP
                    client (ableton.send_command)
  bridge_command — M4L bridge handler, goes through the async UDP M4L bridge
                    client (bridge.send_command), NOT through ableton
  mcp_tool       — in-process Python function, dispatched via an mcp_registry
                    dict supplied by the server lifespan
  unknown        — not a valid target anywhere; returns a clear error

Step-result binding:
  Any step may carry an optional step_id. Later steps may reference an
  earlier result by setting a param to {"$from_step": "<id>", "path": "a.b"}.
  Resolved recursively BEFORE dispatch.
