        track cleanup, and tempo set so the agent can focus on creativity.

#   "smart":            warp tonal layers (pad/bass/lead/vocal) always;
#                       leave drum/perc loops un-warped IF source/project

    """Server-side execution helper for ``compose(mode="full")`` plans.

    Pass the full output dict from a prior ``compose(prompt, mode="full")``
    call and this tool walks every step in the plan: creates tracks,
    loads Splice samples (with the same post-load hygiene fast mode uses —
    Volume=0, Ve Mode active, Classic playback, warp on for loops),
    inserts effects, sets parameters (with `$from_step` device-index
    resolution baked in), creates source clips with trigger notes, and
    builds the section-by-section arrangement.

    `warp_strategy` (BUG-FULL-MODE-12, 2026-05-01) controls whether
    Splice loops snap to the project tempo:

      - ``"always"`` (default) — every loop warps to project tempo.
        Production-safe: a 90-bpm drum loop in a 122-bpm project will
        play in tempo via Simpler's Beats warp algorithm.

      - ``"smart"`` — tonal layers (pad/bass/lead/vocal) always warp;
        drum/perc loops are left UN-warped when source/project ratio
        lands on a magic polyrhythmic value (0.5, 0.667, 0.75, 0.8,
        1.25, 1.333, 1.5, 2.0) within ±2%. The 90→122 case scores 0.738
        which is within tolerance of 0.75 (3:4 cross-rhythm) → un-warped
        → produces the J Dilla / Madlib intentional-tempo-mismatch
        chopping where each clip iteration retriggers the source loop
        from the start, creating off-grid stutter rhythms.

      - ``"chop"`` — never warp anything (full creative chopping mode).

    Pre-flight (BUG-FULL-MODE-4): loads the LivePilot Analyzer on master,
    detects fresh-project default tracks, deletes them down to one
    survivor before the plan starts creating tracks at indices 0+.

    Post-flight (BUG-FULL-MODE-5): prunes the leftover default-track
    survivor if it remained empty after the plan finished.

    Plan-side bug-fix (2026-05-01) — the planner's effect-param table at
    `mcp_server/composer/layer_planner.py::_ROLE_TEMPLATES` was emitting
    legacy-Compressor / dB-direct values that fail on modern Compressor 2
    + Saturator + EQ Eight (which all use 0-1 normalized params). That
    table has been corrected to match `fast.py`'s convention. As a result,
    full-mode plans now apply cleanly without unit-conversion gymnastics.

    Returns: per-step outcomes (with the original `step_id` / `description`
    preserved for diagnostics), pre-flight + post-flight action logs,
    total wall time. Failed steps are reported individually but do not
    abort the walk — full-mode plans are tolerant of partial failure.
