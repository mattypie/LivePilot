"""Local-first sample resolution for composer plans.

Moves sample resolution from execution time (where the old pseudo-tool
_agent_pick_best_sample was supposed to "figure it out") to plan time.

Async because splice_remote downloads real samples over gRPC. Filesystem-only
callers still work synchronously from an async perspective — the function
only awaits when it actually has to hit the network.

Returns (local_path, source) where source is one of:
  'filesystem'    — hit in a provided search_root directory (no network)
  'splice_local'  — Splice catalog hit that's already downloaded (no credit spend)
  'splice_remote' — Splice catalog hit that required download (1 credit)
  'browser'       — Ableton browser match with a local path
  'unresolved'    — no match; caller drops the layer from the plan and warns

Preference order is fixed: filesystem > splice_local > splice_remote > browser.
Filesystem wins even if Splice has a faster hit — local files are free.

Role-aware filesystem ranking (v1.10.3)
----------------------------------------
Filesystem matching used to return the first file whose name contained the
role OR any query token. This caused obvious musical mistakes — a `lead`
layer would get matched to `drums_techno.wav` because both share the genre
token "techno". The Truth Release (v1.10.3) replaces that with a scored
ranker that considers:

  * role word in filename                 (+3.0)
  * filename's primary role == layer role (+1.5 bonus)
  * filename's primary role == a DIFFERENT role (-5.0 penalty)
  * role-adjacent hint words (e.g. kick/snare for drums) (+2.0)
  * query token overlap, excluding the role word itself (+0.5 per token)
  * tempo token (e.g. "128bpm") shared between filename and query (+1.0)

A candidate must score strictly above 0.0 to be returned. This blocks the
obvious failure mode where genre-only matches override role matches or
where unrelated files with no signal get returned just because they're
the first audio file found.
