"""Composer branch producer — emit section-hypothesis BranchSeeds.

PR11 adds a branch-native entry point alongside the existing compose()
pipeline. Instead of a single deterministic layer plan, callers can
request N distinct compositional hypotheses and audition them via
create_experiment(seeds=..., compiled_plans=...).

Design:
  A composer branch is a CompositionIntent + variant_strategy. Three
  canned strategies are shipped in PR11:

    "canonical"     — intent unchanged, layer plan uses genre defaults
    "energy_shift"  — intent.energy inverted around 0.5 (dense ⇄ sparse)
    "layer_contrast" — one role swapped in the layer plan (e.g. bass
                       role replaced with pad-anchor, or percussion
                       stripped to emphasize melodic content)

Seeds carry source="composer". Each branch produces a pre-compiled
plan through the existing ComposerEngine.compose() pipeline so
run_experiment respects the plans without re-compiling. Later PRs
can add more strategies (key-shift, section-reorder, tempo-halftime).
