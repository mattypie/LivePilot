"""Full-mode brief builder — Phase 1 of the LLM-creative two-phase flow.

Takes a prompt (and optional seed_state for "extend an existing project"
flows) and returns a brief carrying VOCABULARY for the agent to design
the song's form from.

CRITICAL: The brief MUST NOT contain predetermined section sequences, bar
counts, or fixed variant taxonomies. The agent decides the form per call.
The framework only provides:
- Parsed intent (genre/mood/tempo/key from the prompt)
- Genre/artist character vocabulary (descriptive)
- The 42-event structural lexicon (named primitives, not a sequence)
- Atlas instrument candidates per role
- Live manual snippets for likely devices
- Optional seed_state for extension flows
- Research hooks (WebSearch directives for niche styles)
- An open-ended design_targets text describing the variation surface

Phase 1 stubs: genre_context, atlas_candidates_per_role, manual_snippets,
event_lexicon — empty values now, populated by Phase 4 KnowledgePack.

_DESIGN_TARGETS = (
    "Design a full-track arrangement from the prompt and (when provided) "
    "the seed_state. You decide every aspect of the form: section sequence, "
    "section bar counts, drop placement (or absence), breakdown placement, "
    "outro length, hook reveal/withholding/restatement schedule, element "
    "entry/exit choreography across the timeline. Use the genre_context and "
    "artist_context as flavor (sonic character, gear preferences, harmonic "
    "stance) — they describe what a style sounds like, NOT how to structure "
    "the song. Use the event_lexicon as a vocabulary of named structural "
    "moves to schedule at chosen phrase boundaries. For niche style references "
    "in research_hooks, run WebSearch to ground your form choices in the "
    "actual conventions of that subgenre. Submit your design as a plan to "
    "compose_full_apply with: per-track variant clips at chosen scene slots, "
    "per-section arrangement_clip placements referencing those variants, "
    "and structural events scheduled at phrase boundaries. The form is YOUR "
    "creative product — vocabularies tell you what techno or BoC sound like, "
    "they do not tell you the bar count of an intro."
