# Changelog

## v1.27.1 — 2026-06-21

Maintenance release: 35 verified fixes from a deep multi-agent audit, recursive installed-plugin scanning, and Windows-CI hardening. No change to the tool surface (467 tools / 56 domains).

### Restored — tools that were silently broken
- `augment_with_samples`, `get_composition_plan`, `propose_composer_branches` — crashed or returned nothing since the v1.24 refactor removed section templates; they now degrade to a single full-length section.
- `check_clip_key_consistency` — always returned `"unknown"` (removed FastMCP `.fn` accessor).
- `compare_phrase_renders` — returned an identical empty critique; now analyzes each render.

### Fixed — correctness
- Reference engine: project spectrum and stereo width are now populated (gap analysis previously ran against an all-zero project).
- `infer_section_purposes`: drops are no longer mislabeled as tension.
- Grader: master/return/group tracks identified by their real field names (group containers were inflating track counts).
- Hook salience: the memorability boost no longer fires on every candidate.
- Mix: the `flat_dynamics` critic is now reachable (`over_compressed` is a 3–6 dB band).
- Wavetable adapter uses the real `Osc 1 Pos` parameter name.
- Simpler slice playback uses the correct base note (36+N); `vibe_fit` energy proxy normalized.
- Harmony and phrase-grid analysis read from the correct clip slot.
- `exclude_globs` now match files inside named directories.
- A single shared technique store so in-session saves are visible to recall/search.
- Read-only prefix matcher no longer misclassifies mutating tools as safe.
- Atlas id/name collisions no longer shadow entries; the overlay index is no longer rescanned per namespace.
- AMXD device-type map recognizes MIDI Tool devices (Live 12.1+).
- `apply_full_plan_v2` postflight no longer deletes a reused existing track.
- Fatigue level no longer diluted by low-severity issues; energy-arc no longer desyncs on skipped scenes; `create_preview_set` no longer silently overwrites an existing set.

### Fixed — installed-plugin scanning (#44)
- The plugin scanner now recurses into vendor subfolders (e.g. `VST3/<Vendor>/Plugin.vst3`); nested plugins are found and vendor folders are no longer emitted as junk inventory records.

### Fixed — safety and resources
- Splice `is_free` misclassification that could bypass credit/quota gating.
- Experiment rollback undoes only `remote_command` steps (no longer reverts unrelated edits).
- Timed-out write commands are dropped instead of re-executing later on the main thread.
- Order-tolerant M4L bridge chunk reassembly (no permanent response loss on UDP reordering).
- Installer install-path guard hardened; Splice bearer token gated to splice.com HTTPS hosts; non-numeric Live version strings tolerated instead of crashing the capability probe.

### Performance
- Blocking sample I/O (SQLite, file decode, FFT, network) moved off the asyncio event loop.
- Capped previously-unbounded tool responses (`atlas_device_info`, `extension_atlas_search`, corpus synthesis briefs, piano-roll matrix, plugin `sdk_metadata`).
- Deduped redundant session round-trips (`enter_wonder_mode`, `build_project_brain`).

### CI and tooling
- Fixed the Windows CI matrix (cp1252 `UnicodeEncodeError` in verifier scripts; POSIX-path test fixture).
- `build_mcpb.sh` enforces `.mcpbignore`; portable dev scripts.

### Dependencies
- fastmcp, soundfile 0.14.0, grpcio 1.81.1, protobuf 7.35.1.

## v1.27.0 — 2026-06-16

Probe-first Live 12.4 capability release.

### Added

- Added read-only `probe_link_audio()` and `probe_stem_workflow()` runtime tools. They report observed capability modes and reasons without invoking UI scripting, menu automation, or destructive stem operations.
- Added `link_audio` and `stem_workflow` capability domains to `get_capability_state()` and `get_session_kernel()`. Both default to `manual_only` unless a real probe supplies routable/callable evidence.
- Added Live 12.4 version flags for Link Audio, selected-time stem separation, and merge-selected-stems while keeping workflow support probe-gated.
- Added `operation_profile` to the session kernel with `studio_deep` as the legacy default and profile names for `safe_live`, `arrangement_build`, `sound_design_deep`, and `release_audit`.

### Changed

- `replace_simpler_sample()` and `load_sample_to_simpler()` now report `native_attempted`, `bridge_attempted`, and `fallback_reason` so native-vs-bridge behavior is observable during Live 12.4 sample workflows.
- Creative Director guidance now includes a Producer Decision Center: library hunt before loading, inspect enriched atlas hits, avoid Analog/Poli/Drift filler unless explicitly requested, and require instrument/source-level programming before effects-only polish.
- Capability-mode docs now describe the new Link Audio and stem workflow probe domains instead of treating them as undocumented future work.

### Tests

- Added coverage for Live 12.4 version flags, Link/stem capability domains and probe tools, session-kernel operation profiles, sample fallback reporting, and Producer Decision Center contract text.

## v1.26.3 — 2026-06-16

Truth/knowledge patch for Live 12.4.2, local Codex plugin sync, and runtime capability reporting.

### Fixed

- Runtime FluCoMa capability probing now checks the Max/FluCoMa package and live M4L streams instead of a nonexistent Python `flucoma` module, so installed-but-bridge-blocked systems report `flucoma_bridge_unavailable` or `flucoma_no_streams` instead of the misleading `flucoma_not_installed`.
- Metadata drift checks now cover `AGENTS.md` bridge-command claims and the runtime capability probe's analyzer-tool unavailable message.
- README compatibility docs now advertise all four Live 12 capability tiers, including the Live 12.4+ Collaborative tier for native Simpler sample replacement.
- M4L bridge docs and operating contracts now distinguish the M4L `replace_sample` empty-Simpler limitation from the Live 12.4+ native `replace_sample_native` route.

### Added

- Added `scripts/verify_codex_plugin_sync.py` to verify the local Codex plugin active dir, versioned cache dir, mirrored manifests, `.mcp.json`, payload directories, and Local Plugins marketplace entry.

### Changed

- Refreshed Live 12.4.2 knowledge notes for Link Audio, stem-selection workflows, Erosion, Chorus-Ensemble, Delay LFOs, Max 9.1.4, and `SimplerDevice.replace_sample`, while keeping unprobed Link Audio/stem workflows marked as future LivePilot work.

### Tests

- Added drift guards for AGENTS bridge-command claims, analyzer-tool capability probe text, README Live tier docs, and Codex plugin sync verification.

## v1.26.2 — 2026-05-27

Patch release for Claude/Codex plugin instruction correctness and local install reliability.

### Fixed

- Claude/Codex plugin commands now use `ensure_analyzer_on_master` instead of direct master-track analyzer loading, preserving the invariant that `LivePilot_Analyzer` measures the final post-master-chain signal.
- `/beat` now builds the master processing chain before ensuring the analyzer, preventing pre-effect spectral/RMS reads in fresh sessions.
- V2 semantic-move guidance now matches runtime behavior: `apply_semantic_move(mode="improve")` compiles an approval-ready plan and does not execute until the returned steps are run.
- Plugin device-loading guidance now routes through the Device Atlas first, then exact browser URI loading, with `find_and_load_device` reserved for simple built-in effects.
- Release checklist stale claims were corrected: removed the obsolete non-analyzer subtotal and updated the domain-list reminder from 45 to 56 domains.
- Producer-agent capability guidance now distinguishes stale/intermittent analyzer data (`measured_degraded`) from analyzer absence (`judgment_only`).

### Tests

- Added `tests/test_plugin_instruction_contracts.py` to prevent regressions in analyzer preflight guidance, semantic-move approval semantics, release-count claims, and core-skill enriched-device metadata coverage.

## v1.26.1 — 2026-05-24

Patch release for installer/release hygiene and live execution correctness.

### Fixed

- Codex plugin installer now copies the full plugin payload into Codex's local plugin cache, writes the lowercase `.codex-plugin` manifest mirror, and prunes stale cache versions.
- Full composer analysis now routes MCP-side analysis tools through the MCP dispatch registry instead of sending non-Remote-Script commands over TCP.
- Remote Script write-command detection now classifies newer mutating handlers by prefix so they receive write timeouts and settle delays.
- M4L bridge OSC builder now rejects unsupported argument types instead of silently emitting malformed OSC payloads.
- `develop_apply` bridge ping call now passes timeout correctly instead of serializing a dict as an OSC argument.
- Creative skills no longer route eclectic/rule-breaking requests to a private missing `livepilot-eclectic` skill.
- Metadata/docs refreshed for 56 domains, 465 tools, and 44 semantic moves.
- Social banner SVGs and release checklist paths now reference the current 465-tool / 56-domain project state.

### Added

- Public `CONTEXT.md` with repo vocabulary and architecture decisions.
- Initial `LivePilot_Elektron` M4L SysEx bridge artifact and JS bridge scaffold.

### Tests

- Added contract coverage for Codex cache installation, MCP dispatch adapters, Remote Script command registry drift, write-command classification, OSC argument validation, and stale skill references.

## v1.26.0 — 2026-05-09

Rubric grader system + atlas-aware load preflight + Drift factory-fingerprint detection. Closes a chronic-regression class: anti-pattern violations of CLAUDE.md §1/§2/§4/§5/§7.3 now have programmatic enforcement, and silent-instrument loads (Granulator III without a sample) are caught structurally at load time instead of much later via the verifier.

### Added — three new MCP tools

- **`grader_list_rubrics()`** — names of registered rubrics + light/heavy classification. Five rubrics ship: `layer_accumulation` (§7.3), `default_preset_check` (§1), `modulation_presence` (§4), `layer_precision` (§5), `sound_design_depth` (§2).
- **`grader_evaluate(rubric_id, heavy=False, include_brief=True, include_masking=True)`** — runs a single rubric across the current session. Light state (~3s) covers role/volume/banned-default checks. Heavy state (~6s) adds per-clip notes + per-clip automation + wavetable mod-matrix + session masking report — required for §5 sequence/modulation/masking criteria. Returns structured per-criterion verdict + actionable revision_brief markdown.
- **`grader_evaluate_all(heavy=True, include_brief=True, include_masking=True)`** — runs ALL rubrics in one call against shared state. ~5× cheaper than calling `grader_evaluate` per rubric because state-fetching is the dominant cost. Returns per-rubric verdicts + combined_brief.

### Added — Drift factory-fingerprint detection

- `audit/checks._check_drift_params` and `_drift_engagement_score` — captures Drift's 12-param factory fingerprint (Pitch Mod Amt 1/2 = 0.5, Mod Matrix Amt 2/3 = 0.5, Vel > Vol = 0.5, Spread = 0.10, Strength = 0.05, Drift = 0.07, Thickness = 0.0, LP Mod Amt 1 = 0.97, LP Mod Amt 2 = 0.78, LFO Amt = 1.0). Counts deviations from factory > 0.04 epsilon. Zero deviations on a melodic-role track → `unprogrammed_instrument` fail. Closes the §2 detection gap where Drift's bipolar defaults escaped the generic `_SUSPICIOUS_AT_ZERO` heuristic.

### Added — atlas-aware load preflight

- **`atlas_search`** now surfaces 8 discoverability-critical fields when `enriched=true`: `self_contained`, `synthesis_type`, `complexity`, `use_cases`, `signature_techniques_count`, `first_technique_hint`, `gotchas_count`, `first_gotcha`. Truncation widened 120 → 400 chars. Closes the silent-Granulator-III bug class — the agent now sees `self_contained: false` immediately in search results without a follow-up `atlas_device_info` round-trip.
- **`load_browser_item`** now appends `atlas_preflight` to the response when the loaded device is enriched AND declares `self_contained: false`. Includes a structured warning + the actionable hint to load a Sounds preset chain that ships with a sample baked in. Granular samplers (Granulator III, Vector Grain) are caught at load time instead of leaving the agent with a silent instrument.

### Added — `mcp_server/audit/state.py` shared module

Hoists `safe_call`, `fetch_notes_for_clips`, `has_clip_automation`, `count_wavetable_routings` from `audit/tools.py` and `grader/tools.py` into one shared module. Removes the duplication that crept in during Phase 2c-β. Now a third caller can import directly without re-copy.

### Changed — instrument + effect class taxonomy

`audit/checks._INSTRUMENT_CLASSES` and `_EFFECT_CATEGORIES` now include Live's actual runtime class names alongside user-facing brand names. Captured live 2026-05-08:

| User-facing | Runtime class_name |
|---|---|
| Analog | `UltraAnalog` |
| Meld | `InstrumentMeld` |
| Poli | `MxDeviceInstrument` (M4L wrapper) |
| Electric | `LoungeLizard` |
| EQ Eight | `Eq8` |
| Compressor / Compressor 2 | `Compressor2` |
| Auto Filter | `AutoFilter2` |
| Glue Compressor | `GlueCompressor` |
| Multiband Dynamics | `MultibandDynamics` |

§1 banned-default detection now uses `(class_name, name)` fingerprint tuples — catches Drift, UltraAnalog (Analog), InstrumentMeld (Meld), MxDeviceInstrument-Poli (M4L wrapper). Pre-1.26 the flat-set approach only caught Drift.

### Tests

- 8 new test files: `test_grader_layer_accumulation.py`, `test_grader_default_preset_check.py`, `test_grader_modulation_presence.py`, `test_grader_layer_precision.py`, `test_grader_sound_design_depth.py`, `test_audit_state.py`, `test_atlas_search_field_surfacing.py`, `test_browser_atlas_preflight.py`. ~110 new tests covering rubric criteria, false-positive guards, Drift fingerprint, atlas preflight, shared helpers.
- Updated `test_audit_layer.py` (Drift fingerprint + real-class fixtures) and `test_tools_contract.py` (count 462 → 465 + grader tools registered).
- 237 tests pass for the grader + audit + browser preflight surfaces.

### CLAUDE.md additions

- §9b — Kill orphan LivePilot processes (don't ask the user). When a tool errors with `UDP 9880 still in use` or `Another client is already connected`, the active session takes the kill action.
- §9c — Arrangement build finalization. Loop covers full content, cursor at 0, orange button inactive, no leftover session clips. Canonical one-call: `force_arrangement(beat_time=0, loop_start=0, loop_length=<content_end>, play=false)`.

### Live test (this release's evidence)

A 5-layer 130 BPM two-step session built end-to-end exercising all five rubrics, including a 5/4 fill bar, French disco filter sidechain, and a granular drone pad. Multi-violation stress test progressed 0/12 → 8/13 (62%) → 11/12 (92%) → 12/12 (100%) catch rate as fixes landed. The Granulator III silent-instrument bug surfaced during this session and triggered the atlas_search/load_browser_item preflight fix that's now part of this release.

## v1.25.0 — 2026-05-02

Hybrid Knowledge Surface — closes the gap between "compose runs successfully" and "compose makes thoughtful production decisions" by giving the agent three layers of atlas-corpus access during plan design instead of one-shot pre-resolution.

### Added — three new MCP tools

- **`atlas_explore(role, mood, genre, artists?, n=5, avoid_uris?, cohort_constraint?)`** — refined per-role candidate query callable mid-design. Wraps `AtlasResolver.resolve_for_role` with corpus-deep ranking signals: tag/genre match base, signature_techniques mood overlap (+0.20), curated `.adg` boost (+0.10), recent positive preference (+0.10), §1 banned-default penalty for melodic roles (−0.50), opaque-M4L pad penalty (−0.30), §7 #2 anti-repeat (−0.15), caller avoid-list (−0.30). Returns 3-5 ranked candidates with reasoning trails and a cohort_hint inferred from result frequency.
- **`atlas_audition(uri)`** — full sidecar dump for a single URI: character_tags, signature_techniques (joined from `device_techniques_index.json`), producer-curated macro names (joined via `preset_resolver`), curated `.adg` paths, related demos placeholder. Use BEFORE committing to a candidate when its tags alone aren't enough.
- **`atlas_substitute(current_uri, anti_tag, n=3)`** — anti-tag-driven swap for after analyze_sound_design or analyze_mix flags an issue. Substring-matches anti_tag against the 11-key map (bright/harsh/aggressive/sparse/thin/muddy/clean/dark/warm/static/generic) to derive (excluded_tags, preferred_tags), filters role-mate candidates that don't carry excluded character_tags, ranks the survivors with preferred_tags as mood boost.

### Added — framework

- **`mcp_server/composer/framework/atlas_resolver.py`** — `AtlasResolver` class with `resolve_anchors()` (Layer A: cohort + role-anchored URIs at brief-build time, wraps `atlas_pack_aware_compose` with coarse→fine role mapping) and `resolve_for_role()` (Layer B: per-role ranked candidates with cohort_constraint + excluded_uris). `AtlasCandidate` and `AtlasAnchors` dataclasses define the shared shape. Memory-rule constants `BANNED_DEFAULT_MELODIC` and `OPAQUE_M4L_FOR_PAD` are exported.
- **`mcp_server/atlas/explore_tools.py`** — pure-Python implementations for the three new MCP tools, including `_ANTI_TAG_MAP` (11-key inversion table) and `_load_device_techniques_index()` lazy loader.

### Changed — KnowledgePack + brief

- `KnowledgePack.build()` accepts `atlas`, `ableton`, `ctx`, `brief_text` kwargs. When `mode="full"` AND `atlas` AND `brief_text` are provided, populates `atlas_anchors` (best-effort — silently `None` on any failure path).
- `build_full_brief` now threads the atlas object through. The brief carries `atlas_anchors` alongside the existing fields.
- `_DESIGN_TARGETS` text in `full/brief_builder.py` updated to teach the LLM about the three new tools and when to call each.

### Tests

- `tests/composer/framework/test_atlas_resolver.py` — 17 cases covering ranking math (8), `resolve_for_role` (6), candidate shape (1), `resolve_anchors` integration with mocked `pack_aware_compose` (2).
- `tests/atlas/test_explore_tools.py` — 20 cases covering `atlas_explore` (6), `atlas_audition` (5), `_resolve_anti_tags` (3), `atlas_substitute` (6).
- `tests/test_tools_contract.py` — count assertion updated 459 → 462; atlas tool registry expects the three new names.

### Tool count

- Net delta: **459 → 462** (+3: atlas_explore, atlas_audition, atlas_substitute).

### Changed — `resolve_for_role` four-source union

- **`AtlasResolver.resolve_for_role()`** previously queried only the bundled atlas tag index (`self._atlas._by_tag`). User-curated rack instruments and pack overlays were structurally invisible to the agent's design-time queries.
- Two-pass overlay union added via new helper `_gather_from_overlays()`:
  - **Pass A** — explicit `entity_type="demo_project"` query against the `packs` namespace. Demo-project entries (analyzed `.als` parses with `track_names` + `parent_pack` + `device_class_counts`) are the highest-confidence per-role anchors. Each survivor receives a **+0.15 score boost** with reasoning trail entry `"demo_project ground-truth (+0.15)"`.
  - **Pass B** — full overlay search with no namespace filter. Captures `packs/pack`, `packs/cross_pack_workflow`, `m4l-devices/*`, `user.*`, `elektron/*` entries that share role tags.
- New helper `_overlay_entry_to_device()` synthesizes `overlay://<namespace>/<entity_id>` URIs so overlay candidates render in the same shape as factory atlas candidates. Agents resolve to a loadable URI via `extension_atlas_get(namespace, entity_id)` afterward.
- Best-effort: import or runtime failure of the overlay backend silently returns an empty list rather than raising — matches the existing `resolve_anchors` failure semantics.

### Changed — `_DESIGN_TARGETS` four-source search mandate

- Brief text in `mcp_server/composer/full/brief_builder.py::_DESIGN_TARGETS` rewritten to explicitly require the agent to UNION four sources before committing any role pick:
  1. **Source 1 — Factory atlas** (already in `atlas_anchors`): `atlas_explore` / `atlas_audition` / `atlas_substitute`.
  2. **Source 2 — User corpus** (mandatory): `extension_atlas_search(query=role)` and `extension_atlas_search(query=role, entity_type="demo_project")` for ground-truth role→URI mappings, plus `extension_atlas_get(namespace, entity_id)` for full-body inspection.
  3. **Source 3 — Anthropic Ableton Knowledge MCP**: `mcp__Ableton_Knowledge__search_transcripts` / `search_live_manual` / `search_knowledge_base` / `search_videos` for tutorial-grade context.
  4. **Five-step protocol** documented per role: read anchor → atlas_explore → extension_atlas_search (corpus + demo_project) → Ableton_Knowledge search → union, score, commit.
- Production motivation: factory-atlas-only selection consistently missed canonical user-curated rack instruments (e.g., the `808 Trap Selector Rack.adg` from the Trap Drums by Sound Oracle pack lives in the packs overlay, not the factory tag index).

### Fixed — `load_browser_item(role="drum")` post-load defaults

Two compounding bugs in `mcp_server/tools/browser.py` made `role="drum"` a no-op since v1.20:

- **Wrong parameter name** — `_SIMPLER_ROLE_DEFAULTS["drum"]` set `"Sample Pitch Coarse"` to 36, but that parameter does NOT exist on `OriginalSimpler`. The `set_device_parameter` call raised `Parameter 'Sample Pitch Coarse' not found`, was swallowed by the per-param try/except, and silently lost. Replaced with `("Transpose", 24)` (range −48..+48 semitones); +24 compensates for Simpler's default sample root C3 vs the drum-pad MIDI convention C1. Melodic and texture roles updated to `("Transpose", 0)` (no shift — C3 default matches their input range).
- **Device-detection logic never triggered** — wrapper checked `result.get("device_index")` and `result.get("class_name")` from the load response, but the underlying TCP `load_browser_item` command returns only `{loaded, name, device_count}`. Both fields were always `None`/`""`, the `Simpler in device_class` check failed, and the entire role-defaults branch was skipped on every call. Fixed: post-load probe via `get_device_info(track_index, device_index=0)` to read class + name, treating chain-head as the canonical instrument slot Live places fresh instruments at.
- Same broken parameter name was also patched in `mcp_server/tools/_analyzer_engine/sample.py::_simpler_post_load_hygiene`. Auto-detect-drum-root-note now translates `drum_root → Transpose = 60 − drum_root`, clamped to ±48 semitones.
- Response now carries `role`, `role_defaults_applied: [{parameter, value|skipped}…]`, and `device_class` so callers can verify the four defaults landed.

### Added — M4L instrument post-load hygiene

- New `_M4L_INSTRUMENT_HYGIENE` dict in `mcp_server/tools/browser.py` maps a device-name substring to a list of `(parameter_name, value)` tames. Runs **unconditionally** (not gated on `role`) post-load, after Simpler role defaults.
- Initial entry: `Harmonic Drone Generator` (Drone Lab pack) — sets `Latch=0` (off), `Volume=-40` (≈ −20 dB display, vs default ≈ −6 dB), `Density=40` (40 %, vs default 80 %). Without these tames every fresh HDG load slammed an 8-voice drone at full volume the moment any MIDI note hit it. The `Latch` issue compounded by keeping that note ringing forever even after the MIDI source released.
- Response now carries `m4l_hygiene: {device_name, applied: [{parameter, value|skipped}…]}` when a hygiene entry matches. One match per load (`break` after first hit).

### Tests

- `tests/test_next_steps_2026_04_22.py::test_role_defaults_reasonable_for_drum_role` — assertion updated to `Transpose == 24`; regression guard `"Sample Pitch Coarse" not in drum` prevents the broken param name from ever reappearing.
- `tests/test_next_steps_2026_04_22.py::test_role_defaults_reasonable_for_melodic_role` — assertion updated to `Transpose == 0` plus the same regression guard.
- All four role-defaults tests pass against the new `_SIMPLER_ROLE_DEFAULTS` shape.

## v1.24.0 — 2026-05-02

Compose framework rebuild — fast / full / develop modes share an Applier substrate; full mode is a clean-room rewrite around an LLM-creative two-phase brief flow (LLM provides FORM, framework provides VOCABULARY).

### Added — compose framework

- **`mcp_server/composer/framework/applier.py`** — shared pre-flight + post-flight skeleton. `preflight()` loads analyzer, reconnects bridge, retries handshake up to 3× with 200ms gaps (fixes the M4L UDP-bind race that previously left "bridge not connected" failures on the first instrument-load call). `postflight()` sets monitoring=Auto on every newly-created track and calls `back_to_arranger`. Functions are dependency-injected so each mode's apply.py wires its own analyzer/bridge funcs.
- **`mcp_server/composer/framework/knowledge_pack.py`** — `event_lexicon` (42 structural events across 7 categories: drum_density, harmonic, texture, vocal, rhythm_feel, tension, fx_gesture), `genre_context` loader (parses `livepilot/skills/livepilot-core/references/genre-vocabularies.md`, 15 genres), `artist_context` loader (parses `artist-vocabularies.md`, ~25 producers). `atlas_candidates_per_role` is scaffolded but **left as empty stub** — see v1.25 plan.
- **`mcp_server/composer/full/apply.py::apply_full_plan_v2`** — full-mode rebuild. Takes an LLM-authored plan with `form` (sections), `tracks` (instruments + variants + arrangement_clips), `events`. Per-section variants prevent the BUG-FULL-MODE-18 flat tile. Native arrangement clip flow via `create_native_arrangement_clip` + `add_arrangement_notes` + `set_clip_loop` produces a single arrangement clip per section instead of 32 tiny tiles (BUG-FULL-MODE-23).
- **`mcp_server/composer/develop/`** — develop mode (extend an existing 8-bar loop). `seed_introspector.py` classifies tracks by name + content; `brief_builder.py` pulls artist references from the user prompt + research hooks; `apply.py` writes per-track variants without disturbing the seed.
- **`mcp_server/composer/fast/brief_builder.py`** — fast-mode brief authoring with tier classification (Tier-A curated > Tier-B audible default > Tier-C never). Hunt order: `search_browser(path="sounds")` first to surface curated `.adg` chains, then atlas, then bare instruments only as last resort. Bans bare-melodic Tier-B when curated alternatives exist (§1 violation prevention).

### Fixed — live-test wave

- **BUG-FULL-MODE-14: bridge UDP race** — `apply_full_plan` returned success on `bridge.connect()` but the M4L JS listener takes 100-500ms to bind the UDP socket; next bridge call ("UDP bridge is not connected"). Fixed in `Applier.preflight` with handshake retry loop.
- **BUG-FULL-MODE-17: monitoring=In on all tracks** — Phase 4 Task 4 set monitoring `state=0` ("In", always passes input) instead of `state=1` ("Auto", default). Live screenshot showed every track armed-red. Fixed: state=1 in `Applier.postflight`.
- **BUG-FULL-MODE-18: flat tiling instead of per-section variants** — full mode reused one MIDI variant for the whole arrangement. Fixed: per-section `variant_id` in plan + per-section variant resolution in apply.
- **BUG-FULL-MODE-19: `track_index` vs `index` field** — `apply_full_plan_v2` read `result["track_index"]` from `create_midi_track`, but the Remote Script returns `result["index"]`. Same bug class as the v1.23.x `parameter_name` vs `name_or_index` fix.
- **BUG-FULL-MODE-20: zombie/leftover tracks from previous sessions** — postflight only deleted default-named tracks (`1-MIDI`, `2-Audio`). Now also deletes tracks with no clips AND no instrument device (true-empty zombies) regardless of name.
- **BUG-FULL-MODE-21: drum-pitch super-low** — Simpler default root C3=60, drum clips firing at MIDI 36 = 24 semitones below native pitch. Drum-role repair (Volume=0, Snap=Off, Transpose=+24) was already in fast mode; now ported to full mode for parity. (`composer/fast/apply._apply_drum_role_repair` is imported by full mode.)
- **BUG-FULL-MODE-22: arrangement clip length wrong** — fixed alongside BUG-FULL-MODE-23.
- **BUG-FULL-MODE-23: 32-tile arrangement** — `create_arrangement_clip` duplicated the session clip every `loop_length` beats, producing a tile-grid arrangement. Switched to `create_native_arrangement_clip` + `add_arrangement_notes` + `set_clip_loop` for native arrangement clip authoring; one clip per section, looped to fill section length.

### Known gaps (deferred to v1.25)

- **`KnowledgePack.atlas_candidates_per_role` is empty stub** — agent still falls through to `search_browser` filename matching instead of consulting the indexed atlas. Ranking + truncation per role needs careful design (1-2 days). Documented as **BUG-FULL-MODE-24** and is the headline feature of v1.25.
- **Reasoning loop (Scope B)** — full mode currently does best-effort `analyze_mix`/`analyze_loudness`/`analyze_sound_design` calls but doesn't iterate on findings. v1.25 wires an analyze→adjust→re-analyze loop with a budget.
- **Drum craft + bass craft sophistication passes** — full mode produces correct but generic drum/bass programming. v1.25 lifts these to "poweruser" depth (per-bar variation, sidechain wiring, ghost notes, swing curves, sub/mid/click frequency separation).
- **`verify_track_audible` MCP tool** — Phase 4 Task 18c, deferred.

### Tool count
- Net delta: **453 → 459** (+6: compose framework expansion).

### Tests
- `tests/composer/` — 184 passing across fast / full / develop / framework subdirectories.
- `tests/test_tools_contract.py` — 459 tools verified.

## v1.23.6 — 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- **`ensure_analyzer_on_master` cold-start disambiguation.** On a fresh Live boot the User Library browser cache is uncached, and `find_and_load_device("LivePilot_Analyzer")` can exceed the 20s recv timeout while BFS-ing the user library tree. The previous catch-block surfaced `status="install_required"` even though the .amxd is sitting at the canonical install path — sending the agent into a reinstall loop. New `_analyzer_amxd_installed_at_user_library()` filesystem check disambiguates: when the .amxd is present at `~/Music/Ableton/User Library/Presets/Audio Effects/Max Audio Effect/`, the tool now returns `status="cache_cold"` with a retry hint instead. Genuine missing-.amxd path still returns `install_required` correctly. (`mcp_server/tools/analyzer.py`)
- **`set_compressor_sidechain` diagnostic depth.** When `_find_sidechain_surface` returns None on Compressor2 (Live 12.3.6+), the raised error now includes `class=...` + `canonical_parent.class=...` + a widened child-attribute walk (`input_routings`, `routing_inputs` added to the probe). Lets the next live failure leave a tighter trail so the actual Compressor2 LOM shape can be confirmed in one round trip rather than a separate probe session. No behavior change for legacy Compressor (I) or the two known Compressor2 hypotheses. (`remote_script/LivePilot/mixing.py`)
- **`atlas_demo_story` production_decision class-name leak.** `harmonic-foundation` and `rhythmic-driver` role branches fell back to `primary_cls` when `user_name` was empty — producing useless prose like "InstrumentGroupDevice chosen as harmonic spine." Both branches now use `primary_uname or t_name or primary_cls`, matching the texture-role fallback that was already correct. (`mcp_server/atlas/demo_story.py`)
- **`atlas_extract_chain` Macro N labeling on M4L devices.** The rack-device path already resolved producer-named macros via `resolve_preset_for_device`, but the M4L (.amxd) device path emitted raw `Macro N`. Now both paths cross-reference the preset sidecar — PitchLoop89's "Spectral Stretch" gets the proper name instead of "Macro 2" so `set_device_parameter` resolves at execution time. (`mcp_server/atlas/extract_chain.py`)
- **Bundled atlas stats refresh.** `stats.enriched_devices` was stale at `87` (from a v1.21.x scan); the actual `enriched=True` flag count had grown to `135`. Recounted in place. No tool consumes the field with semantically-different behavior, but the stale stat had drifted past the soft-warn threshold's intent. (`mcp_server/atlas/device_atlas.json`)

### Docs / drift

- **`docs/M4L_BRIDGE.md`**: amxd ping reference and bridge-cmd count corrected — was `version: "1.23.1"` and "30 commands" from prior releases; now `1.23.6` and `32`.
- **`livepilot/skills/livepilot-core/references/genre-vocabularies.md`**: added Synthwave / Retrowave / Outrun entry to match the 15-genre claim in CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md (file had 14; the YAML packet at `concepts/genres/synthwave.yaml` had been the source-of-truth for v1.18+).

### Tests

- `tests/test_ensure_analyzer_on_master.py` — 2 new tests under `TestColdBrowserCacheDisambiguation` covering the cache-cold branch (`.amxd` present → cache_cold) and the install-required branch (`.amxd` absent → install_required). Existing `test_returns_install_required_when_device_not_in_browser` updated to monkeypatch the new path-check helper so it exercises the genuinely-not-installed path regardless of dev-machine state.
- Total: **3409 passing**, 1 skipped, 0 failed (up from 3407 in v1.23.5).

### Audit notes

A full read-only audit pass against `BUGS.md` + `BUGS_TESTING_2026-04-30.md` confirmed that 14 of the bugs documented in those files were already fixed in v1.23.4's `bugfixes-2026-04-26` commit batch but never marked closed in the testing doc. No-ops here, but worth noting that the 38-bug list in the testing file is now ~5 genuinely-open items.

## v1.23.5 — 2026-04-30

### Fixed (Remote Script reliability — credit: PR #35 reporter)

Two production-blocking bugs in the Remote Script that ship into the Ableton process. Reported by @juancarlosaxtro-hash in [PR #35](https://github.com/dreamrec/LivePilot/pull/35); reimplemented cleanly here with regression tests because the originally-submitted patch contained Python indentation errors that broke `transport.py` parse.

- **TCP server now replaces stale clients instead of rejecting new connections.** Previously, when the MCP server restarted uncleanly (e.g. user relaunched Claude Desktop), the Remote Script's `recv()` loop didn't notice the disconnect for up to a second. During that window, the legitimate reconnect attempt was rejected with `STATE_ERROR("Another client is already connected")` — often requiring a full Ableton restart to recover. New behavior: when the accept loop sees a new connection while one is "active", it closes the stale socket from the accept loop, joins the old client thread (with 2 s timeout, OUTSIDE the lock so the thread's `finally` block can acquire it), then accepts the new connection. Single-client architecture means a new connection is proof the old one is dead. New `_current_client` field tracks the active socket so the accept loop can kick it; the `_run_client_session` finally only nulls `_current_client` if it still points at the closing client (the accept loop may have already replaced it). (`remote_script/LivePilot/server.py`)
- **`get_session_info` no longer crashes on Group tracks.** `song.tracks` includes Group tracks, which raise a `RuntimeError` on `arm` / `has_midi_input` / `has_audio_input` access. `hasattr()` returns `True` regardless because Live's LOM doesn't use `AttributeError` — only try/except on the actual access works. Without the guard, any session with a Group track failed the entire session-info call with *"Main and Return Tracks have no 'Arm' state!"* Surgical try/except around the three LOM-fragile properties only; other fields (`name`, `color_index`, `mute`, `solo`) populate normally; the fragile ones return `None` on Group tracks. (`remote_script/LivePilot/transport.py`)

### Tests
- `tests/test_remote_server_single_client.py` — rewrote `test_second_client_gets_explicit_state_error` → `test_second_client_replaces_stale_connection` for the new kick-stale semantics.
- `tests/test_remote_transport_group_tracks.py` — new file, 4 tests covering normal-track baseline, mixed Group+normal sessions, all-Group edge case, and non-fragile-field preservation. Hermetic loader stubs the Ableton-only `Live` module + `version_detect` helpers; autouse fixture restores `sys.modules` to prevent test pollution.
- Total: **3407 passing**, 1 skipped, 0 failed (up from 3403 in v1.23.4).

### CI green check
- All 9 jobs green on commit `4aec8e6` (run `25174868624`): metadata-drift, js-entrypoint, amxd-freeze-drift, python-tests × {macos, ubuntu, windows} × {3.11, 3.12}.

## v1.23.4 — 2026-04-30

### Fixed (2026-04-30 live-test wave — 38 bugs surfaced, 36 fixed, 2 deferred to v1.23.5)
- **`als_deep_parse.py` — recursive `iter()` was returning nested rack defaults instead of authored macro values**, so every demo sidecar shipped with all macros at `0`. The fix replaces `device_elem.iter("MacroControls.N")` with a direct-child scan that only reads the rack's own macro controls. Live-verified against `Pioneer Drone` in `drone-lab__earth.als`: macro 1 "Rift Rate" = 1, macro 8 "Volume" = 95.25 (both were 0 before). All 104 demos re-parsed; macro values now match the producer's authored .als state. **This was the highest-impact bug in the wave** — every downstream tool (extract_chain, transplant, demo_story, pack_aware_compose, cross_pack_chain) consumes these macro values, so until this was fixed all phase tools operated on corrupted source data. (BUG-PARSER#1)
- **`als_deep_parse.py` — scale extraction always returned C Major** because `iter("ScaleInformation")` hit per-clip ScaleInformation elements (which default to C Major) before reaching the project-level LiveSet ScaleInformation. Fixed by using `root.find("LiveSet").find("ScaleInformation")` direct path. Added Live-9/10 fallback for `<Root>` vs `<RootNote>`. Voice Box demo 04 now correctly reports F Minor. (BUG-E4)
- **`atlas_demo_story` crashed with `TypeError: tuple | set` on any demo containing GroupTracks** (every Drone Lab and Mood Reel demo). One-character fix: `(_AUDIO_EFFECT_GROUP,) | _FX_BUS_CLASSES` → `{_AUDIO_EFFECT_GROUP} | _FX_BUS_CLASSES`. (BUG-E1#1)
- **`atlas_extract_chain` emitted generic `"Macro N"` parameter names** instead of producer-assigned labels. Live calls to `set_device_parameter(parameter_name="Macro 2")` would silently NOT-FOUND when the rack actually had a name like "Crunch" or "Rift Rate" at that index. Now resolves the matching preset sidecar via the new `mcp_server/atlas/preset_resolver.py` helper and emits the real producer name (e.g. `parameter_name: "Rift Rate"`), with `parameter_index` as a fallback addressing field. Source tag `[SOURCE: als-parse+adg-parse]` when the name was successfully resolved. (BUG-E2#1)
- **`atlas_extract_chain.load_browser_item` steps were missing `uri` and `track_index`** — non-executable as-emitted. Now embeds a `browser_search_hint: {name_filter, suggested_path}` that the agent passes to `search_browser` to resolve the FileId-keyed runtime URI before calling `load_browser_item`. Same pattern applied to `atlas_pack_aware_compose`. The new shared `preset_resolver` module also provides `emit_load_step()` for any future caller. (BUG-E2#4 + BUG-F1#2)
- **`atlas_pack_aware_compose` `transpose_semitones` aesthetic override was a silent no-op** — `for step in steps: step = dict(step); ...` mutated a copy that was never written back. Fixed in [cross_pack_chain.py](mcp_server/atlas/cross_pack_chain.py) (the actual locus despite the bug-id naming). Now `for i, step in enumerate(steps): ... ; steps[i] = step`. (BUG-F2#3)
- **`atlas_extract_chain` emitted `create_audio_track` for `GroupTrack` and `ReturnTrack` source types**, breaking routing topology when the plan was executed. Now emits `create_return_track` for ReturnTrack and `manual_step` (with clear instructions) for GroupTrack since LivePilot has no `create_group_track` tool. (BUG-E2#3 + #7)
- **`atlas_extract_chain` `parameter_fidelity="approximate"` sorted by `abs(value)` instead of deviation-from-default** — pinned-max macros (127) ranked above intentionally-tweaked mid-range macros (50). Now cross-references the matching preset sidecar's factory default values and sorts by `abs(demo_value - preset_default)`. Falls back to `abs(value)` when no sidecar match. (BUG-E2#5)
- **`atlas_extract_chain` listed `PluginDevice` in `_NATIVE_INSTRUMENT_CLASSES`** — would have emitted non-executable `insert_device(device_class="PluginDevice")` for any third-party VST/AU. Now routes PluginDevice to `manual_rebuild` action with vendor-name lookup instructions. (BUG-E2#PluginDevice)
- **`atlas_extract_chain` fuzzy track-name match silently picked the first hit** when multiple tracks contained the substring (e.g. `track_name="plane"` against `drone-lab__emergent-planes` which has 6 tracks containing "Plane"). Now emits `matched_track` echo + `ambiguity_warning` listing the other candidates. (BUG-extract_chain-fuzzy)
- **`atlas_macro_fingerprint` synonym dict failed on producer-stylized Unicode macro names**. Drone Lab presets use names like `"Nøize Ω"`, `"MØD Rate"`, `"Fil†er Amount"`, `"BLASTS ++"` — the dict had bland canonicals (`"volume"`, `"attack"`, `"tone"`) and never matched. Same-pack same-class lookup returned 0 matches despite 37 candidate sibling presets. Added `_ascii_fold()` with explicit Unicode glyph substitutions (ø→o, †→t, Ω→empty) before NFKD decomposition. Live-verified: same canonical repro now returns 4 matches (was 0); `MØD Rate` correctly canonicalizes to `lfo_rate`. (BUG-D#2)
- **`atlas_macro_fingerprint.matching_macros` truncated to 1-2 items** even when many macros overlapped, defeating score auditing. Now caps at 5 with a `total_matching_macros: int` count field so callers know the full overlap. (BUG-D#3)
- **`atlas_macro_fingerprint` docstring promised live-source path that raises `NotImplementedError`**. Updated to disclose that as of v1.23.4 only the corpus-source path is implemented; live-source is stubbed and returns an actionable error. (BUG-D#1)
- **`atlas_transplant` REMAP `executable_steps` used naive global transpose**, not pitch-class-set transformation. The `_remap_pitch_class` function existed and computed correct per-note offsets but was only used in human-readable detail strings. Demo sidecars don't expose clip note data so per-note `modify_notes` (Option A) wasn't viable. Switched to Option B: emit `set_song_scale` step paired with the existing reasoning artifact, leveraging Live's scale-snap for scale-locked clips. Documented the limitation for non-snap clips. (BUG-C#1)
- **`atlas_transplant` Phase-D macro-fingerprint suggestions carried wrong `decision` verb** (REMAP instead of REPLACE) — agents iterating the plan and matching `decision == "REMAP"` would conflate scale-degree transforms with preset-swap suggestions. Changed to REPLACE. (BUG-C#3)
- **`atlas_transplant` accepted invalid `source_namespace` and silently fell through** to a minimal-fallback struct with a generic warning. Added explicit allow-list guard at function entry — returns `{"error": "Unknown source_namespace: '...'", "status": "error"}`. (BUG-C#4)
- **`atlas_transplant` output `source.entity_id` echoed input form instead of canonical resolved slug** (`drone_lab__earth` stayed underscored even after the lookup resolved against the hyphenated sidecar). Now resolves to canonical hyphen form. (BUG-C#5)
- **`atlas_transplant._detect_producer_anchor` returned only the first match** in `_PRODUCER_ANCHORS`, so `target_aesthetic="arca metallic"` on a `drone-lab` source silently lost the Arca anchor. Now checks target_aesthetic keywords first (more relevant), then source entity_id, deduplicates, and joins both anchors into the reasoning artifact. (BUG-C#6)
- **`atlas_pack_aware_compose` Henke/Monolake artist alias mapped to wrong slug** because `_parse_artist_section` slugified `"Robert Henke (Monolake)"` to `"robert_henke_monolake"` while `_ARTIST_ALIASES` pointed `"henke"` and `"monolake"` to `"robert_henke"`. The vocabulary lookup returned empty → pack_anchors never loaded → cohort dilution. Fixed by stripping parenthetical aliases in `_parse_artist_section` before slugifying. Same fix automatically resolves Aphex Twin, OPN, Plastikman, Com Truise, and any other artist with parenthetical alternates. Verified: dub-techno-spectral-drone-bed brief now correctly produces a `[pitchloop89, convolution-reverb, drone-lab]` cohort. (BUG-F1#1)
- **`atlas_pack_aware_compose` `track_count` silently capped at 12** with no signal that the response was truncated. Extended `_DEFAULT_ROLE_MIX` from 12 to 20 entries, added `requested_vs_returned: {requested, returned, max_supported}` field when truncation happens. (BUG-F1#3)
- **`atlas_pack_aware_compose` had ~30 latent vocabulary gaps** for cross-workflow themes (footwork, breakcore, juke, jungle, orchestral, etc.) and 9 broken genre aliases pointing to nonexistent vocab keys (`"ambient"` → `"ambient"` when the vocab key was `"ambient_drone"`). Footwork/breakcore briefs no longer fall through to a generic ambient cohort. (BUG-F1#4 + 9 latent broken aliases)
- **`atlas_pack_aware_compose` eclectic mode for Mica Levi briefs returned `"industrial pastoral"` boilerplate** because Mica Levi was missing from `_ARTIST_ALIASES`, orchestral packs were missing from `_PACK_AESTHETIC_AXES`, and `tension_resolution` was a static template that didn't interpolate the actual cohort. Added Mica Levi + Bibio + Caterina Barbieri + Henderson + Iftah + Reich + Reznor/Ross aliases; added orchestral pack axes; rewrote tension_resolution to interpolate the real cohort. (BUG-F1#5)
- **`atlas_pack_aware_compose` preset deduplication broke under small cohorts** — 4 of 6 tracks could end up with the same preset because `_select_preset_for_role` early-exited on "strong" fingerprint, ignoring the caller's `used_presets` exclusion intent. Now threads `used_presets` into the function and skips already-used during scoring. Verified: a representative `decayed-pad` brief now produces 6 unique presets across 6 tracks. (BUG-F1#6)
- **`atlas_pack_aware_compose` wrote `tension_resolution` to BOTH `track_proposal[0]` AND `reasoning_artifact`** (double-write). Removed the track-level write; the reasoning artifact is the source of truth. (BUG-F1#7)
- **`atlas_cross_pack_chain` numeric value extractor matched digits inside device names** — text "PitchLoop89 with Pitch A +0.05 cents" returned `89` instead of `0.05`. Added negative lookbehind `(?<![A-Za-z\d])` to the regex. (BUG-F2#1)
- **`atlas_cross_pack_chain` mid-line `→` inside parentheses shattered one step into 3 garbage steps** — Henke workflow text "(voice A → R, voice B → L)" caused the splitter to emit three truncated lines. Replaced bare `re.split` with paren-aware splitter that masks `(...)` blocks before detecting split positions. (BUG-F2#2)
- **`atlas_cross_pack_chain` verb pattern `"chain "` false-positively matched `"Sidechain"` and `"master-bus chain"`** — text like "Sidechain Compressor on the 808" wrongly classified as `set_track_send`. Tightened to `"chain to "` / `"chain into "`. (BUG-F2#5)
- **`atlas_cross_pack_chain` numbered-continuation lines retained stale step number in `raw_text`** — output step renumbered as 3 still had `raw_text` starting with `"2. → ..."`. Now appends number-stripped `content` instead of original `line`. (BUG-F2#6)
- **`atlas_cross_pack_chain.workflow_meta` did not propagate `devices_used`** from the YAML — callers had to re-query the atlas to know what devices a workflow needed. Added the field. (BUG-F2#7)
- **`atlas_cross_pack_chain` pack-prefixed load lines mis-classified as `manual_step`** — text like `"Inspired by Nature \`tree_tone\` on a sustained Cmaj7 chord"` (pack name shadowing the device-name match) failed `startswith` check on `_KNOWN_DEVICE_FRAGMENTS`. Extended classifier to substring-search the device fragment in the first 80 chars after the prefix, with `_` → space normalization so `tree_tone` matches the `tree tone` fragment. (BUG-F2#4)
- **`atlas_demo_story` `focus_tracks` filter was exact-match only** — `focus_tracks=["drum","kit"]` against track named `"4-Ship Noise Kit"` returned empty. Now uses fuzzy substring match: `not any(tok.lower() in t_name.lower() for tok in focus_tracks)`. (BUG-E2-focus)
- **`atlas_demo_story` terse mode stripped the producer-vocabulary anchor** — the terse branch never called `_detect_producer_anchor` even though pack identity is the most useful anchor in a 2-3 sentence summary. Now emits one-line anchor in terse output. (BUG-E3)
- **`atlas_demo_story` `production_decision` fell back to raw class name** when `user_name` was empty — `"'InstrumentGroupDevice' adds textural density."` Now falls back to track name when user_name is missing. (BUG-E5)
- **`atlas_demo_story` bad-ID error suggested a shell command** (`"use ls ~/.livepilot/..."`) instead of listing real demo IDs an LLM caller can actually use. Now enumerates `DEMO_PARSES_ROOT` and includes 10 real `available_demos` in the error response. (BUG-E6)
- **`ensure_analyzer_on_master` cold-start timeout** — first call after Live boot timed out at 15 s on a fresh empty session even when the analyzer was at the expected User Library path. Recorded as a known intermittent (workaround: retry; underlying browser-cache cold-start latency). Tracked but not fixed in v1.23.4. (BUG-T#1)

### Added (architectural — supports the Phase E/F fixes above)
- **`mcp_server/atlas/preset_resolver.py`** — new shared helper module that maps a demo track's device (class + user_name) to its matching preset sidecar. Returns `{found, match_type, sidecar_path, preset_name, macro_names: {idx: name}, browser_search_hint: {name_filter, suggested_path}, preset_file}`. Powers BUG-E2#1 (Macro N → real names) and BUG-E2#4 + BUG-F1#2 (load_browser_item URI hint). Exposes `resolve_preset_for_device()`, `lookup_macro_name()` convenience getter, and `emit_load_step()` for plan emitters. Tested at 12/12 with synthetic + real-corpus integration tests.
- **38 net-new tests** across the wave (12 preset_resolver + 19 extract_chain + 7 cross_pack_chain new test classes + supporting fixtures). Total suite: **3313 passing, 1 skipped, 0 failed** (up from 3180 in v1.23.3).

### Fixed (2026-04-30 round 5 — deep verification + 16 surfaced bugs)
After rounds 1-4 the suite was at 3323 tests passing. Round 5 dispatched 3 parallel sonnet agents for deep verification (corpus-wide crash sweep, cross-tool integration, edge cases + property invariants) — all 6 property invariants passed (`load_browser_item` shape, dry-run flag, scale source provenance, macro addressing, chain depth ≤4, REPLACE steps populated). The crash sweep covered **104 demos × 6 tools** with 0 failures. Integration + edge testing surfaced 16 NEW bugs that 4 fix agents resolved in parallel.

- **`atlas_transplant` PRESERVE `load_browser_item` steps were missing `browser_search_hint`** while `extract_chain` and `pack_aware_compose` had been emitting them since round 4 — inconsistent across tools, breaking the `search_browser → load_browser_item` execution pattern when an agent pulled a transplant plan. Fix routes through `preset_resolver.emit_load_step` with manual fallback. Verified: 6/6 PRESERVE steps on `drone-lab__earth` cinematic transplant now carry hint. (BUG-NEW#1)
- **`atlas_transplant` REPLACE decisions stripped the `detail` field** from `translation_plan` entries — agents iterating the plan to read `detail.remove_device` / `detail.add_device` always got `None`, even though `executable_steps` had the right delete/insert sequence. The internal decision dict carried `detail`, but the plan-builder only copied `element/decision/rationale/executable_steps`. Single-line fix added `"detail": dec.get("detail")` to the dict-builder. (BUG-INT#3)
- **Type-coercion family (5 bugs) — direct Python callers crashed on string-typed numeric params.** The MCP transport layer's `_coerce_schema_property` widens int/number params to also accept strings (Pydantic lax-mode coerces at the boundary), but direct callers bypass that. `atlas_macro_fingerprint(top_k="10")` raised `TypeError: slice indices must be integers`. `atlas_pack_aware_compose(track_count="5")` raised `TypeError: '<' not supported between 'int' and 'str'`. `atlas_pack_aware_compose(target_bpm="125.0")`, `atlas_transplant(target_bpm="130.0")`, and `atlas_cross_pack_chain(customize_aesthetic={"target_bpm": "bogus"})` all crashed similarly. Fix added `_coerce_int()` / `_coerce_float()` helpers in `pack_aware_compose.py` and try/except guards at every wrapper-level cast. Bogus strings now silently fall back to defaults instead of crashing. (BUG-EDGE#1, #2, #3, #4, #5)
- **`transplant()` accepted `target_scale_root=99` (out of pitch-class range) and stored it verbatim**, emitting an invalid `set_song_scale root=99` step. `tools.py` wrapper guard only rejected `< 0`, not `> 11`. Updated guard to `not (0 <= target_scale_root <= 11)` with explicit `-1` sentinel carve-out. Verified: `target_scale_root=99` returns a clear error, `target_scale_root=11` (B) still works. (BUG-EDGE#7)
- **`transplant()` inner function had no sentinel guard for `target_scale_root=-1`** — direct callers got a phantom REMAP decision and an invalid `set_song_scale root=-1` step. Fixed at function entry: normalize `< 0` to `None` to match the wrapper. (BUG-EDGE#6)
- **`atlas_cross_pack_chain` `load_browser_item` steps missed `browser_search_hint` when leading-noun lines defeated the device-name regex.** Lines like `"→ Echo with subtle wow/flutter"` and `"→ Reverb with cathedral IR"` were correctly classified as `load_browser_item` (because "echo" / "reverb" are in `_KNOWN_DEVICE_FRAGMENTS`) but `_extract_device_name()` returned None — no `device_name` → no hint. Fix adds a fallback scan of the first 80 chars against `_KNOWN_DEVICE_FRAGMENTS` after the regex misses. New `_FRAGMENT_TO_SUGGESTED_PATH` dict routes native FX fragments to `audio_effects` and synth fragments to `instruments` instead of the broad `sounds` default. Affected workflows: `boc-decayed-pad` (Echo, Reverb), `bibio-diy-bedroom-pop`, `henke-full-granular-chain`. (BUG-INT#1 / BUG-NEW#3)
- **`atlas_cross_pack_chain` `transpose_semitones` override silently no-op'd on 13/15 workflows** — the override loop only mutated existing `set_device_parameter` steps with parameter_name containing "pitch/note/transpose/tune", but most workflows parse as `manual_step` or `load_browser_item`. The transpose request was silently dropped. Fix appends a `manual_step` row signaling the transpose attempt when no existing steps are mutated. Verified: `boc_decayed_pad` with `transpose=-3` now emits 1 `manual_step`; `dub_techno_spectral_drone_bed` (which DOES have parseable Pitch A param) still mutates values without double-emit. (BUG-NEW#2)
- **Chain-recursion asymmetry — `atlas_extract_chain` and `atlas_demo_story` weren't walking into `dev.chains[]` even though `atlas_transplant` was** (added in round 2). On `mood-reel__chapter-one-by-thomas-ragsdale` track `3-Saturn Ascends`, `transplant` correctly surfaced Erosion (6 occurrences), but `extract_chain` reported only `[InstrumentGroupDevice, Delay, AudioEffectGroupDevice]` and `demo_story`'s narrative said the same — a producer asking "what's in this rack?" got 3 different answers from 3 tools. New `_collect_inner_chain_classes(dev, depth)` helper in extract_chain.py walks chains up to depth 4 and exposes them via a new `inner_chain_classes` field on each device + a compact `chain_summary` field on the rack's `load_browser_item` / `manual_rebuild` step (e.g. `"Nasal Bass → Pedal → Erosion → Limiter"`). `demo_story.py`'s `_build_chain_summary` was rewritten to recurse with bracket notation: `"InstrumentGroupDevice (Saturn Ascends) [InstrumentVector → Pedal → Erosion → Limiter]"`. Plan size unchanged (no nested execution steps). (BUG-INT#2)
- **`atlas_extract_chain` empty `track_name` silently picked the first track** because `"" in any_string` is always True in Python — pass-2 of `_find_track_by_name` matched every track. Added entry-point guard returning `{"error": "track_name is required and cannot be empty.", "available_tracks": [...]}`. (BUG-EDGE#8)
- **`atlas_pack_aware_compose` cap-at-20 truncation wasn't surfaced in `warnings`** — the `requested_vs_returned` field had it, but callers iterating the canonical `warnings` list missed the alert silently. Fix appends a human-readable warning when truncation happens. (BUG-EDGE#9)
- **`atlas_pack_aware_compose` `pack_cohort` was nested inside `brief_analysis`** but the docstring + CLAUDE.md described it as top-level — `r.get("pack_cohort")` returned None, breaking caller code that followed the docs. Added top-level alias while keeping `brief_analysis.pack_cohort` for backwards compatibility. (BUG-NEW#4)

### Fixed (2026-04-30 round 4 — startup warning + PluginDevice metadata)
- **Tool-count startup warning fired spuriously on direct tool-module imports.** Importing any tool module (e.g. `mcp_server.atlas.tools`) triggered `server.py` to run its self-test mid-import — at that moment, the importing module's own `@mcp.tool()` decorators hadn't yet fired (Python suspends the original import while server.py loads), so the registry probe under-counted by ~19 tools and the user saw `STARTUP SELF-TEST WARNING — _get_all_tools() returned 420 tools, expects 439` even on a healthy install. Fix: split `_assert_tool_registry_accessible()` into two phases. The "registry probe is at all accessible" guard (`actual > 0` — catches FastMCP internals breakage) stays at module load. The exact-count comparison (`actual == expected`) moved into a new `_assert_expected_tool_count()` called from `main()`, so all tool-module imports have completed regardless of which import path brought server.py in. The contract test (`tests/test_tools_contract.py::test_total_tool_count`) is unchanged and remains the authoritative drift gate. (BUG-T#2)
- **PluginDevice metadata extraction.** Third-party VST/AU/AAX plugins were previously surfaced as opaque `{class: "PluginDevice", user_name: "Serum"}` in sidecars, leaving `extract_chain`'s `manual_rebuild` step with nothing more than a class name to feed the agent. The .als XML format actually exposes plugin identity in plain XML (only the per-plugin parameter buffer is binary). New `_extract_plugin_metadata()` parses the `<PluginDesc>` block and pulls `{format, name, manufacturer, file_name, unique_id, exposed_param_count}` for VstPluginInfo / Vst3PluginInfo / AuPluginInfo / AaxPluginInfo variants. The factory-pack corpus contains zero PluginDevice instances (factory content can't depend on user-installed plugins), so 8 synthetic-XML fixture tests guard against rot. `extract_chain.py` was updated to surface the plugin field + emit a `browser_search_hint: {name_filter: "<plugin display name>", suggested_path: "plugins"}` so the agent can `search_browser` to find the plugin in Live's plugins/ folder. The note text now reads "'X' is a VST plugin by Valhalla DSP. Use search_browser..." instead of the previous generic placeholder. Param VALUES remain opaque per the .als format limitation — documented in the note. Old sidecars without the `plugin` field continue to work via the user_name fallback. (BUG-PARSER#5)

### Fixed (2026-04-30 round 3 — scale data enrichment)
- **Live 9/10 `.als` files left scale mode as a numeric index in 44 demo sidecars** (every Building Max Devices tutorial, plus a few cross-pack files). `scale.name` was a digit string like `"0"` or `"10"` instead of a mode name. Added `_LIVE_MODE_INDEX_TO_NAME` mapping (15 modes including the older Whole Tone / Diminished / Pentatonic / Harmonic Minor / Melodic Minor variants) and decode at the bottom of `get_scale()`. Verified: `building-max-devices__after-effects-export` now reports `Major` (was `"0"`); `final-result` reports `Minor Blues` (index 10); `arpeggiator` reports `Dorian` (index 2). Bonus discovery: `lost-and-found__lost-and-found-demo-set-01` now correctly surfaces `Harmonic Minor` (was masked as `"0"`). All 44 affected sidecars resolved. (BUG-PARSER#3)
- **Mood Reel construction-kit `.als` files store `C Major` at the LiveSet level** even when the producer-meaningful key is encoded in the filename (e.g. `Hope For The Future Fmin 130 bpm.als`). Ableton populated the per-clip ScaleInformation but left the project-level default. Added a filename-key fallback: when the .als-extracted scale is the C Major default AND the filename matches `\b([a-g][#b]?)(maj|min)\b`, the sidecar overrides with the filename-derived key and stamps `scale.source: "filename-fallback"`. When the .als has a non-default scale, it's trusted (`scale.source: "als-extract"`). Verified end-to-end via `atlas_demo_story` and `atlas_transplant`: Hope For The Future now reports `F Minor` (was C Major); Empty Streets reports `F# Minor`; Bright Side reports `G Major`. All 19 affected Mood Reel sidecars corrected. The 36 demos that genuinely have no key (tutorials, drone improvisations) keep `als-extract` C Major — fallback only fires when the filename actually encodes a key. (BUG-PARSER#4)

### Fixed (2026-04-30 round 2 — both deferred parser bugs)
- **`.adg` parser dropped 4 of 8 named macros on Pioneer Drone** (and similar ratios on other multi-rack presets). Root cause was richer than BUG-PARSER#1: the outer `InstrumentGroupDevice` literally stores generic `"Macro 4/5/6/8"` strings in its own `MacroDisplayNames` elements — the authentic names ("Movement", "Attack", "Release", "Volume") only exist on a nested `DrumGroupDevice`'s `MacroDisplayNames`. Ableton resolves the displayed name at runtime by following the macro binding encoded in each inner rack's `MacroControls.<i>/KeyMidi`: `Channel=16` signals an Ableton rack-macro mapping and `NoteOrController` holds the **outer rack macro index** the inner macro is bound to. The parser now scans nested branch presets for these `Channel=16` bindings and back-fills any "Macro N" slot on the outer rack with the inner rack's named `MacroDisplayNames.<i>`. Live-verified: Pioneer Drone now exposes all 8 names (Rift Rate, Crunch, Pitch, Movement, Attack, Release, Reverb, Volume); spot-checks on Shimmer & Sheen and Tubular Bells likewise resolve every named slot. All 3,813 .adg files re-parsed in 52.3 s. (BUG-PARSER#2)
- **Demo `.als` sidecars now expose nested rack-chain devices** — the `extract_device_summary` function previously returned a flat dict per device with no `chains` field, so REPLACE rules in `atlas_transplant` couldn't see Vinyl Distortion / Erosion / Redux when they lived inside racks (which is where producers actually put them). New schema (Schema A — nested): each rack device gains `"chains": [{"name": str, "devices": [<recursive>]}]`, with recursion capped at depth 4. The new `_extract_rack_chains()` helper follows `branch → DeviceChain → *DeviceChain → Devices` so it covers every Live chain variant (MidiToAudio, AudioToAudio, MidiToMidi) without hardcoded class names. All 104 .als files re-parsed in 13.0 s. Atlas-side `_extract_source_structure` in [transplant.py](mcp_server/atlas/transplant.py) was extended with `_walk_device_chain()` that recursively flattens the new schema into `device_inventory` — REPLACE rules now fire correctly. **42 demos in the corpus** now expose REPLACE-targetable devices (was 0 before this fix); end-to-end verification on `mood-reel__chapter-one-by-thomas-ragsdale` produces 2 REPLACE decisions (Vinyl Distortion + Erosion → Saturator/remove for `clean orchestral` target). (BUG-C#2)
- **End-to-end victory:** `atlas_extract_chain(demo_entity_id="drone-lab__earth", track_name="Pioneer Drone", parameter_fidelity="exact")` now produces an 11-step plan where ALL 8 macros carry producer-assigned names AND match the live Ableton ground truth values exactly: Rift Rate=1.0, Crunch=40.0, Pitch=77.0, Movement=10.0, Attack=115.0, Release=115.0, Reverb=64.0, Volume=95.25. Before this session: 2-step plan with no values and no URI. Before this round: 8 values but only 3 producer-assigned names.

### Added (User Corpus + Plugin Knowledge Engine — flagship feature)
- **User Corpus subsystem (`mcp_server/user_corpus/`)** — 14 new MCP tools that turn LivePilot's reasoning brain from "Ableton-shipped only" into "your actual library". The factory atlas knows 5264 devices across 33 Ableton packs; the user corpus indexes whatever else is on your machine — third-party VST3 / AU / AUv3 / VST2 / AAX / CLAP / LV2 plugins, your `.amxd` Max for Live devices, your `.adg` rack library, your sample folders. The result lives at `~/.livepilot/atlas-overlays/user/<entity_type>/<id>/identity.yaml` and is loaded by every reasoning tool (`atlas_search`, `atlas_chain_suggest`, `atlas_macro_fingerprint`, `atlas_describe_chain`) alongside the factory atlas, with each result tagged `source: factory_atlas | user_overlay:<namespace>` so the agent always knows whether a recommendation came from Ableton stock or your gear.
- **Plugin Knowledge Engine — 4-phase pipeline** (`mcp_server/user_corpus/plugin_engine/`):
  - **Phase 1 — DETECT (`detector.py`)** — Walks platform plugin folders (`/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/{VST3,Components}`, `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/{VST3,Components}`, `~/Library/Application Support/Avid/Audio/Plug-Ins`, etc.) AND runs `auval -a` to enumerate AUv3 / Mac Catalyst plugins that don't live in standard Components folders. The auval path closed a silent ~66-plugin coverage gap on iOS-port-to-Mac plugins (Moog Animoog Z, Model 15, Cem Olcay's MIDI suite, Drambo, FieldScaper, AudioLayer, Audulus 4 — all previously invisible). Captures format, vendor, version, bundle ID, AU 4-char codes resolved via bundle reverse-DNS + copyright-string regex.
  - **Phase 2 — CANONICALIZE (`tools.py::corpus_canonicalize_plugins`)** — Dedupes by `(canonical_vendor, normalized_name)` and prefers VST3 > AU > AAX/VST2/CLAP/LV2 as the primary format. Vendor canonicalization strips suffix variants ("Valhalla DSP, LLC" / "Valhalladsp" / "Valhalla DSP" all resolve to `valhalla`). Each canonical record carries `formats_available: [VST3, AU, AAX]` for reference but emits **exactly one** `format:<primary>` tag for indexing — eliminates the dual-indexing bug where a single plugin would show up twice in `format:au` AND `format:vst3` searches.
  - **Phase 2.5 — CLUSTER (`tools.py::corpus_cluster_plugins`)** — Groups canonicalized plugins by vendor for batched research. Vendors with ≥2 plugins (Cem Olcay, ChowDSP, Valhalla, Moog, ElliottGarage) get one shared WebSearch + N synthesis runs; singletons get standalone treatment. Cuts per-plugin token cost by 3-5× on coherent product lines.
  - **Phase 3 — RESEARCH (`tools.py::corpus_discover_manuals` + `corpus_research_targets`)** — Locates local manual files (PDFs, READMEs, plugin-bundle docs), then emits a structured WebSearch task packet the agent fulfills. The packet specifies queries, expected fields, and citation format so research output is consumable by Phase 4.
  - **Phase 4 — SYNTHESIZE (`research.py` + `corpus_emit_synthesis_briefs`)** — Emits per-plugin briefs for sonnet-subagent dispatch. Each brief contains synthesis_inputs (manual + research_cache + preset_examples) and the synthesis_schema specifying every required field: `entity_id`, `entity_type: "installed_plugin"`, `name`, `description`, `tags` (with the **exactly-one-format** rule), `artists`, `sonic_fingerprint`, `reach_for`, `avoid`, `key_techniques`, `parameter_glossary`, `comparable_plugins`, `genre_affinity`, `producer_anchors`. The schema explicitly tells the agent what makes a producer-actionable identity vs a generic feature list.
  - **Trim tool (`tools.py::corpus_trim_plugin_identity`)** — For utility plugins the user explicitly deprioritizes, slims an existing yaml to the overlay-required minimum (entity_id, entity_type, name, description, tags, artists). Used to keep search hits clean — a Pure Data wrapper or internet-radio AU stays indexed but doesn't bloat search context with its full schema.
- **Scanner ABC + 4 namespaces (`mcp_server/user_corpus/scanners/`)** — Pluggable scanner registry. Built-in scanners: `amxd` (Max for Live devices — patcher-JSON inspection for tag enrichment beyond filename keywords), `preset` (.adg / .aupreset / .vstpreset), `als` (project files), `audio` (sample folders), `plugin_inventory` (the Phase 1 detector wrapped as a scanner). Each scanner emits to its own namespace under `~/.livepilot/atlas-overlays/`: `user/`, `m4l-devices/`, `packs/`, `elektron/`. AppleDouble `._*` files explicitly excluded across all scanners (a real bug that bit 217 .amxd devices in the personal corpus dogfood).
- **Atlas overlay reasoning wiring (`mcp_server/atlas/overlays.py` + `tools.py`)** — `atlas_search`, `atlas_chain_suggest`, `atlas_macro_fingerprint`, and `atlas_describe_chain` now consult the user overlay alongside the bundled atlas with a 50/50 result-budget split. Each result carries `source` tagging so the agent knows the provenance. New `OverlayIndex` singleton with AND-token search semantics across all 4 namespaces (~800+ entries indexed end-to-end on a typical machine). Loader is idempotent and lazy — `load_overlays()` mutates the singleton in place, so reload is safe.
- **Tokenizer fix for hyphenated producer-vocabulary queries (`overlays.py::_tokenize`)** — Producer-style queries use natural-language phrasing ("Kraftwerk-style bass", "OTT-style multiband", "J Dilla SP-404 vibe") that the previous whitespace-only splitter rejected because hyphenated tokens never substring-matched indexed fields. Fixed: tokenize on whitespace + hyphens + apostrophes + slashes; drop stop-words (`style`, `vibe`, `tone`, `mood`, `era`, `school`, `like`, `kind`, `feel`, …); drop tokens shorter than 3 chars except domain-preserved short tokens (`fm`, `eq`, `808`, `303`, `dx`, etc.). End-to-end verification: "Kraftwerk-style bass" → `[kraftwerk, bass]` → `moog-model-d`; "OTT-style multiband" → `[ott, multiband]` → `brambos-woott`; "hysteresis tape" → `chow-chowtapemodel`.
- **`livepilot/skills/livepilot-corpus-builder/` skill** — Agent skill that drives the 4-phase pipeline interactively. Walks the user through path confirmation, scanner selection, AI-annotation opt-in. Documents the canonicalize → cluster → research → synthesize dispatch pattern, the Wave A vs singleton-batch routing, and the post-process trim step for deprioritized plugins.
- **`docs/USER_CORPUS_GUIDE.md` + `docs/PLUGIN_KNOWLEDGE_ENGINE.md`** — Full walk-through documentation. The corpus guide covers the user-facing pipeline (detect → canonicalize → cluster → research → synthesize) with example commands. The engine doc covers the architectural complement: how the engine indexes "what the plugins ARE" (sonic identity) vs the file-level corpus indexing "what's on disk" (file inventory).
- **Tool count: 439 → 453** (14 new `corpus_*` tools).

### Added (original v1.23.4 entries)
- **`atlas_pack_aware_compose` + `atlas_cross_pack_chain`** — Pack-Atlas Phase F. Two orchestration tools that wire the corpus into the LivePilot composer and execute multi-pack workflows. `atlas_pack_aware_compose` bootstraps a project with pack-coherent track selection from an aesthetic brief — parses artist/genre vocabularies, builds a pack cohort, selects real presets via macro-fingerprint similarity, and returns a full executable plan. Supports `pack_diversity="eclectic"` mode for deliberate aesthetic-conflict compositions with `tension_resolution` reasoning artifact. `atlas_cross_pack_chain` executes any of the 15 cross-pack workflow recipes step-by-step — parses signal_flow (numbered multi-line, list-of-strings, or list-of-dicts) into load_browser_item / insert_device / set_device_parameter / fire_clip / set_track_send actions; supports aesthetic overrides (`target_scale`, `target_bpm`, `transpose_semitones`); all execution is dry-run (result: "dry-run"). Both tools integrate Phases C+D+E: macro-fingerprint for preset selection, extract_chain step structure for executable plans, transplant aesthetic-replace logic for overrides. New files: `mcp_server/atlas/pack_aware_compose.py`, `mcp_server/atlas/cross_pack_chain.py`. Tool count: 437 → 439.
- **`atlas_demo_story` + `atlas_extract_chain`** — Pack-Atlas Phase E. Two complementary tools that turn the 104 demo .als sidecars into actionable artifacts. `atlas_demo_story` synthesizes a track-by-track narrative + production-sequence inference + suggested learning path from a demo sidecar. `atlas_extract_chain` surgically rebuilds a specific demo track's device chain as a dry-run execution plan (load_browser_item + insert_device + set_device_parameter steps), with three parameter-fidelity modes: exact, approximate, structure-only. Both tools read from local JSON sidecars — no Live connection required. New files: `mcp_server/atlas/demo_story.py`, `mcp_server/atlas/extract_chain.py`. Tool count: 435 → 437.
- **`atlas_transplant`** — Pack-Atlas Phase C. Source-to-target structural translation: adapts a demo project, preset chain, or workflow recipe from one musical context (BPM, scale, aesthetic) to another. Four decision types: PRESERVE (pitch intervals, macro ratios), SCALE (rhythmic density × BPM ratio with sanity clamp at ratio > 2.0), REMAP (scale-locked notes via pitch-class-set transformation, 7-mode table), REPLACE (aesthetic-incompatible devices — e.g. Vinyl Distortion → Saturator for cinematic target). Returns structured plan with executable `load_browser_item`, `set_device_parameter`, `set_clip_pitch`, `set_tempo` steps. Producer-vocabulary anchors in `reasoning_artifact` for known pack/aesthetic combinations. Integrates Phase D macro-fingerprint matcher for preset-source paths. New file: `mcp_server/atlas/transplant.py`. Performance: <0.4s p95. Tool count: 434 → 435.
- **`atlas_macro_fingerprint`** — Pack-Atlas Phase D. "More like this" search across all 3,813 preset sidecars by macro-fingerprint similarity. Source can be any corpus preset (pack slug + sidecar path). Scoring: 0.6 × macro-name-overlap-ratio (synonym-aware — 30-key synonym dict, top corpus vocabulary) + 0.4 × (1 − mean value distance). Returns top-K matches with per-match rationale prose and `[SOURCE: adg-parse]` citation. New file: `mcp_server/atlas/macro_fingerprint.py`. Performance: <0.3s p95 full corpus scan (3,813 sidecars, 33 packs). Live-device source path stubbed with `NotImplementedError` (`TODO: Phase D follow-up`). Tool count: 433 → 434.

## v1.23.3 — 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **`classify_simpler_slices` now classifies slices when `file_path` is omitted (the v1.12 follow-up, finally closed).** The tool's docstring promotes "Always run this before programming drum patterns on a sliced break", but the file_path lookup had been a no-op since v1.11 — wrapped in `try/except` with the comment *"Bridge command may not exist yet"* and a fallback error message *"v1.12 follow-up"*. End-to-end verification against Ableton 12.4 + a Splice sliced break ("ff_mch_122_drum_loop_first_perc.wav"): all 23 slices get correct `label` (KICK/SNARE/HAT/ghost) + spectral breakdown, no manual `file_path` argument needed.
- **Pivot from M4L bridge to Remote Script TCP** for the file-path lookup. The bridge round-trip surfaced a chunked-response correlation issue under live testing (the second successive `bridge.send_command` returned the *previous* command's payload). The Remote Script handler reads `device.sample.file_path` directly via Live's Python LOM — no UDP packets, no chunk reassembly, no ambiguity. Implementation:
  - `remote_script/LivePilot/simpler_sample.py` — adds `@register("get_simpler_file_path")` handler. Resolves the SimplerDevice (with Drum Rack chain support via optional `chain_index` / `nested_device_index`), reads `device.sample.file_path`, returns `{file_path, track_index, device_index, name, ...}`.
  - `mcp_server/runtime/remote_commands.py` — registers `get_simpler_file_path` in `REMOTE_COMMANDS` (TCP path, primary). The pre-existing entry in `BRIDGE_COMMANDS` stays for forward-compat — `execution_router.classify_step` puts REMOTE_COMMANDS first, so plans route TCP, but the bridge case is still callable as a fallback.
  - `mcp_server/tools/analyzer.py::classify_simpler_slices` — Remote Script TCP call is primary; M4L bridge `bridge.send_command("get_simpler_file_path", …)` is the fallback path. Surfaces the Remote Script's specific error verbatim (e.g. "Simpler.sample.file_path is empty — sample may be embedded") instead of the generic v1.12 message.
  - `m4l_device/livepilot_bridge.js` — `case "get_simpler_file_path"` + `cmd_get_simpler_file_path()` remain in the .amxd freeze for the fallback path.
- **ff29381 (carried forward)**: `insert_rack_chain` returns `chain_index` so `add_drum_rack_pad` no longer clobbers chain 0 on the second pad. Live-verified against an empty Drum Rack on Ableton 12.4 — three sequential `insert_rack_chain` calls (`chain_index=0`, then `1`, then `0` with `chain_count=3` after position-0 insert).

### Improved
- **CI freshness gate is now source-of-truth-aligned.** The `amxd-freeze-drift` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` previously grepped for `"version": "X.Y.Z"` (the runtime ping JSON form), which only landed in the .amxd via post-export binary patching. Since the v1.20-era refactor to `"version": VERSION` (variable reference), every release needed manual byte-patching to satisfy this gate. Now greps for `var VERSION = "X.Y.Z"` — the source-of-truth declaration in `bridge.js` that always survives a Max freeze. No more binary-patching hack required for plain version bumps.

### Bridge surface
- 31 → 32 cases (`get_simpler_file_path` added — used as forward-compat fallback only; primary path is Remote Script TCP).
- ⚠️ Re-freeze required for the .amxd. New freeze at `m4l_device/LivePilot_Analyzer.amxd` (md5 changed) — distributed to `~/Music/Ableton/User Library/Presets/Audio Effects/Max Audio Effect/` and `~/Documents/Max 9/Library/`. Workflow memory `feedback_amxd_edit_via_maxpat.md` updated to clarify the project-folder JS (`~/Documents/Max 9/Max for Live Devices/<DeviceName> Project/code/livepilot_bridge.js`) is the authoritative path Max freezes from — NOT the user search path `~/Documents/Max 9/Code/`.

### Remote Script
- 191 → 193 handlers. `+1` for `get_simpler_file_path` (this release). The other +1 came from a prior session's reload-handler registration count.

### Tests
- `test_bugfixes_2026_04_25.py` (locks the `chain_index` contract from ff29381) — passes.
- `test_analyzer_tools.py::test_classify_simpler_slices_returns_error_when_no_file_path` — updated to reflect the v1.23.3 error contract: when both Remote Script and bridge fall back, the Remote Script's specific error (e.g. "Simpler.sample.file_path is empty") is surfaced verbatim.
- Full suite: 3180 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed.

### Live-test verification log (Ableton 12.4)
- `classify_simpler_slices(track=4, device=0)` on a 23-slice WAV drum break with no `file_path` argument → returns full classification (KICK/HAT/ghost labels + spectral % per slice). ✓
- `classify_simpler_slices` with explicit `file_path` argument → bypasses lookup, classifies normally. ✓
- `insert_rack_chain` end-to-end on empty Drum Rack → `chain_index` derivation correct in all 3 branches (append-on-empty, append-on-N, position-0-on-N). ✓

## v1.23.2 — 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- M4L bridge `.amxd` ping version now matches the release version. v1.23.1 shipped with the frozen `LivePilot_Analyzer.amxd` still embedding `"version": "1.23.0"` (the m4l_device files weren't bumped during the v1.23.1 patch), which tripped the `amxd-freeze-drift` CI guard introduced after past releases lost to the same drift. In-place binary patch at offsets 32653 + 6691677 (same byte count, file size unchanged at 6,754,576 bytes), plus source bumps in `livepilot_bridge.js` (`var VERSION`) and `LivePilot_Analyzer.maxpat` (UI label) so the next freeze starts in sync.

### Notes
- Bridge functionality is unchanged from v1.23.1. This is a metadata-only patch: end users who looked at the bridge UI in v1.23.1 saw "1.23.0" — that's now corrected.
- All distribution channels (npm, GitHub release MCPB, marketplace mirror) are re-published from this commit.

## v1.23.1 — 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- `extension_atlas_search` multi-word queries returned 0 hits because the search did literal-substring matching. `"sophie ponyboy"` failed to match `"SOPHIE — Ponyboy kick"` because of the em-dash separator. Now: query is tokenized on whitespace, each token must match somewhere (AND semantics), per-token scores sum for ranking. Single-token queries collapse to the original behavior — fully backwards-compatible.

### Tests
- 3 new tests covering multi-token AND, em-dash separator handling, per-token score aggregation.

## v1.23.0 — 2026-04-25

### Added
- **User-local atlas overlay mechanism** for extending the atlas with namespaced YAML content from `~/.livepilot/atlas-overlays/<namespace>/` (custom hardware libraries, signature chains, technique recipes). Survives npm updates. Generalizes the v1.22.0 user-scan pattern from "atlas data" to "any user-local namespace."
- 3 new MCP tools (430 → 433):
  - `extension_atlas_search(query, namespace?, entity_type?, limit?)` — weighted substring search across overlay entries
  - `extension_atlas_get(namespace, entity_id)` — fetch a single overlay entry with full body (including `requires_firmware` if present)
  - `extension_atlas_list(namespace?)` — enumerate namespaces + entity_type counts
- New file: `mcp_server/atlas/overlays.py` — `OverlayEntry` dataclass, `OverlayIndex` class, `load_overlays()`, lazy path resolver, module-level singleton.
- New doc: `docs/EXTENSION_API.md` — public API contract for extension authors.

### Behavior
- Atlas overlays load at server boot from `~/.livepilot/atlas-overlays/`. Non-fatal — server continues if missing or malformed.
- Loader uses `yaml.safe_load` only (rejects Python tags). Per-file parse failures log a WARN and skip the file; per-entry validation failures log a WARN and skip the entry; duplicate `(namespace, entity_type, entity_id)` last-loaded wins with a WARN.
- For `entity_type: signature_chain`, `tags` and `artists` are required (search ranker depends on them). Other entity types treat these as optional.
- `entity_id` and `entity_type` are str-coerced to defend against YAML scalar values like `entity_id: 42`.

### Notes for extension authors
- The contract (`OverlayEntry` field names, `extension_atlas_*` tool API) is stable from v1.23.0 forward.
- Tool-name collisions: FastMCP enforces first-registered-wins. Bundled tools always beat extensions.
- Phase 2 (user-local Python extensions via `register(mcp)`) lands in a future minor version.

## 1.22.1 — Bundled enrichment coverage gate (April 25 2026)

Closes the one item carried from v1.22.0's atlas-separation work: a
visibility + soft-gate for the drift between the atlas file's
self-reported enrichment count and the YAML files on disk.

### What changed

Two enrichment numbers now surface in `sync_metadata --check`:

- **`enriched=N`** (existing) — YAML profiles authored in `mcp_server/atlas/enrichments/`. Measures "what's available for merge."
- **`bundled_enriched=N`** (new) — `stats.enriched_devices` from the shipped `mcp_server/atlas/device_atlas.json`. Measures "what the last scan_full_library run actually applied at build time."

These measure different things. YAML count is authoring effort; bundled
count is runtime coverage as of the atlas's last regeneration. They
drift naturally (someone adds a YAML without re-scanning) — but until
v1.22.1 the drift was invisible to CI.

### Soft gate

Warns (doesn't fail) on two conditions:

1. **`bundled_enriched == 0`** with YAMLs on disk — scanner never ran
   or failed completely. Most likely the repo's bundled atlas got
   accidentally emptied or mis-committed.
2. **`bundled_enriched / yaml_count < 50%`** — scanner truncated or had
   severe pack-coverage failures. Current shipped atlas is 87/120 = 72%
   coverage (healthy — the 33 orphan gap is the miditool-domain YAMLs
   that Live's browser scanner can't see).

Why soft: the relationship `yaml >= bundled` is only true in
single-pack-scan scenarios. Multi-category duplication (native +
max_for_live + user_library for the same device_id) can push
`bundled > yaml`. Strict equality would produce false alarms. The soft
gate catches the two real failure modes while staying silent on healthy
cases.

### Output format

```
Source of truth: version=1.22.1, tools=430, domains=53, bridge_cmds=31,
                 enriched=120, bundled_enriched=87, genres=4, moves=44,
                 analyzer_tools=38, atlas_devices=5264
```

Warnings (if any) print above the fail/pass line with a ⚠️ header,
separate from the issue list. The exit code is unchanged — warnings
don't fail CI.

### Tests

7 new TDD tests in `tests/test_claim_consistency.py`. Full suite: 3143
pass (3136 prior + 7 new), 1 skipped.

### Why this is a patch, not a feature

Pure CI-gate tightening. Zero user-visible runtime behavior change;
the only observable delta is one additional field in the banner plus
the possibility of a soft-warning line during `sync_metadata --check`.
No new tools, no atlas behavior change. The v1.22.0 user/bundled split
is the feature release; v1.22.1 is its mechanical follow-through.

## 1.22.0 — User atlas separation: ~/.livepilot/atlas/ (April 25 2026)

First v1.22 release. Splits the device atlas into two files that serve
different roles — a long-standing ambiguity that finally bit hard enough
to be worth fixing at minor-version scope.

### What changed

**New: `~/.livepilot/atlas/device_atlas.json`** — the **user atlas**.
Written by `scan_full_library` on your machine. Reflects YOUR installed
packs, User Library, and plugins. Lives in the user-data directory
(same convention as `~/.livepilot/memory/`) so `npm install livepilot`
upgrades can't blow it away.

**Unchanged: `mcp_server/atlas/device_atlas.json`** — the **bundled
baseline**. Ships with the package (still 5264 devices, 120 enriched
— stock Ableton 12 Suite inventory). Gives fresh installs a functional
atlas before any personalized scan has run.

**Resolution** at load time: user atlas wins if present, else bundled
baseline falls through. Writes **always** go to the user path; the
bundled path is read-only from the scanner's perspective.

### Why this matters

Prior to v1.22.0, the single `mcp_server/atlas/device_atlas.json` file
served three conflicting roles — repo seed, personal scan cache, and
runtime index. Three bugs resulted:

1. **`npm install livepilot` wiped personal scans.** Every package
   update overwrote the installed atlas with the bundled baseline. Users
   who had carefully scanned their library (30-90 seconds per scan) lost
   that work on every upgrade with no warning.
2. **Dev installs polluted the repo.** Contributors running
   LivePilot from a git checkout would scan their library (to test atlas
   tools against live Ableton) and accidentally commit their personal
   scan — pack names, user-library previews — to the public repo. This
   happened once in the v1.21.x cycle and was the proximate trigger for
   v1.22.
3. **The "enriched" count ambiguity.** A single atlas file couldn't
   honestly answer "how many devices are enriched?" — the right number
   differed depending on whether you meant the bundled baseline (87 per
   the scanner's last truncated pass), YAML files authored on disk (120),
   or runtime coverage including native/M4L duplicates (137+ on a
   fully-scanned install). The user/bundled split clarifies this by
   letting each file carry its own honest count.

### Migration for existing users

Users with a personalized scan in `mcp_server/atlas/device_atlas.json`
(most dev-install contributors) can migrate in one command:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.livepilot/atlas
cp "$(python3 -c 'import mcp_server.atlas; print(mcp_server.atlas.BUNDLED_ATLAS_PATH)')" \
   ~/.livepilot/atlas/device_atlas.json
# Then optionally restore the bundled baseline to its shipped state:
git -C $(python3 -c 'import mcp_server.atlas, pathlib; print(pathlib.Path(mcp_server.atlas.__file__).parents[2])') \
    checkout mcp_server/atlas/device_atlas.json
```

Users on the npm-installed path (no personalized scan yet) need nothing
— the next `scan_full_library` call will write to the new user path
automatically.

### Code changes

- `mcp_server/atlas/__init__.py` — new module-level constants
  `BUNDLED_ATLAS_PATH`, `USER_ATLAS_DIR`, `USER_ATLAS_PATH`, and
  function `_resolve_atlas_path()`. Existing `ATLAS_PATH` kept as a
  backward-compat alias pointing at the resolved value.
- `mcp_server/atlas/tools.py::scan_full_library` — writes to
  `USER_ATLAS_PATH` and creates the user-data directory on demand.
  Enrichments still read from the bundled package (they're authored
  in-repo under `mcp_server/atlas/enrichments/`).

### Tests

8 new TDD regression tests in `tests/test_atlas_user_override.py`:

- `test_bundled_path_is_in_package_dir`
- `test_user_path_is_in_home_dir`
- `test_resolver_returns_user_path_when_present`
- `test_resolver_falls_back_to_bundled_when_user_atlas_missing`
- `test_atlas_manager_loads_from_user_path_when_present`
- `test_atlas_manager_falls_back_to_bundled_when_user_atlas_missing`
- `test_scan_full_library_writes_to_user_path`
- `test_user_atlas_dir_created_if_missing`

Full suite: 3136 pass (3128 prior + 8 new), 1 skipped.

### Documentation

- `docs/manual/getting-started.md` — new "Step 5 (optional): Personalize
  the device atlas" section.
- `docs/manual/dev-install.md` — new "3a. User atlas vs bundled atlas"
  subsection, critical for contributors.
- `docs/manual/device-atlas.md` — header callout on the two-file split.
- `CLAUDE.md` + `README.md` — short pointers to the new resolver.

### Carried to future releases

The atlas schema-canonicalization originally deferred from the v1.21.2
audit is now **partially closed**: the user/bundled split makes the
"which number counts as enriched?" question honest per-file, but the
sync_metadata gate for `stats.enriched_devices` vs YAML file count
hasn't been added. Deferred to a future patch because it's orthogonal
to the user-atlas split.

## 1.21.4 — v1.21.2 audit carry-over: slashed-compound filler + dev-install runbook (April 25 2026)

Ships two items the v1.21.2 audit #2 deferred to v1.22 but that turned
out to be safer to close in a patch cycle than to carry forward:

1. **`check_prose_claim` regex widen for slashed/chained compound fillers** —
   `"38 spectral/analyzer tools"` drift across 3 docs silently passed
   `sync_metadata --check` because the filler group required trailing
   whitespace. Now caught.
2. **Dev-install runbook** (`docs/manual/dev-install.md`) — documented
   path for contributors to run LivePilot from a local checkout without
   publishing to npm. Previously every contributor had to reverse-engineer
   this from `bin/livepilot.js` + `mcp_server/__main__.py`.

No API changes. No user-observable behavior change at runtime. Four new
TDD regression tests for the regex widening; ~180 lines of new
documentation. `sync_metadata --check` now catches an entire class of
compound-form drift that would otherwise have shipped untracked.

### 1. `sync_metadata` slashed/chained compound filler

All 4 regex patterns in `scripts/sync_metadata.py` (`check_tool_count`,
`check_prose_claim`, `fix_tool_count`, `_fix_count`) had an optional
filler group that required trailing whitespace —
`[A-Za-z]+\s+` — and matched at most once (`?` quantifier). Slashed
compounds like `"spectral/analyzer"` were rejected because `/` is not
whitespace; chained compounds like `"spectral/MCP tools"` (two filler
segments) were rejected because of the single-match quantifier.

v1.21.4 widens the filler to two branches, iterable 0+ times:

| Branch | Pattern | Matches |
|---|---|---|
| (a) Space-joined, uppercase-anchored | `[A-Z][A-Za-z\-]*\s+` | `"MCP "` in `"430 MCP Tools"` |
| (b) Slash-joined, any-case | `[A-Za-z][A-Za-z\-]*/` | `"spectral/"` in `"38 spectral/analyzer tools"` |

The uppercase anchor on branch (a) is preserved deliberately — without
it, lowercase English articles ("the tool") would false-positive on
prose like "released in 2020 the tool was first previewed." The slash
on branch (b) is itself an unambiguous compound marker that doesn't
appear in normal English, so any-case there is safe. The `*` quantifier
lets branches chain: `"300 spectral/MCP tools"` now parses as
`(b)"spectral/"` + `(a)"MCP "` + `"tools"`.

For `check_prose_claim` + its paired `_fix_count`, the filler is a
simpler single-branch `[A-Za-z][A-Za-z\-]*(?:/|\s+)` — these don't need
the uppercase anchor (prose-claim nouns predate the v1.21.4 cycle and
already allowed lowercase-start fillers).

**Concrete effect**: `sync_metadata --check` now flags drift in all 3
real surfaces that previously escaped:

- `README.md` — `"38 spectral/analyzer tools"` × 2
- `docs/manual/getting-started.md` — `"38 spectral/analyzer tools"` × 1
- `livepilot/skills/livepilot-release/SKILL.md` — `"38 spectral/analyzer tools"` × 1

(Today these say "38" and the count is 38, so no drift reported — but
the next time the analyzer module gains or loses a `@mcp.tool`, CI will
fail loudly instead of silently drifting.)

Tests added to `tests/test_claim_consistency.py` (4):

- `test_prose_claim_catches_slashed_compound` — drift detection
- `test_fix_count_rewrites_slashed_compound` — `--fix` preserves the adjective
- `test_tool_count_catches_slashed_compound` — chained filler (`"300 spectral/MCP tools"`)
- `test_tool_count_no_false_positive_on_year_prose` — uppercase anchor guard

### 2. Dev-install runbook

New file `docs/manual/dev-install.md` (~180 lines) documents the
bare-python local-checkout workflow for contributors:

1. **venv setup** — `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Local Remote Script install** — `node bin/livepilot.js --install` (NOT `npx livepilot --install`, which resolves to the registry and silently discards local edits)
3. **MCP client config pointing at `python -m mcp_server`** — per-client examples for Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor/VS Code
4. **Iterate loop** — client restart for `mcp_server/` edits; `node bin/livepilot.js --install` + `reload_handlers` tool for `remote_script/` edits
5. **Test suite** — `python -m pytest tests/ -q` (3128 tests as of v1.21.4)
6. **`sync_metadata` drift check** — `python scripts/sync_metadata.py --check` / `--fix`
7. **Going back to published** — remove the dev MCP entry or stop using it

Plus a troubleshooting section for the 4 most common first-run failures:
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp_server'`, `Another client is
already connected` on port 9878, stale `__pycache__` shadowing edits, and
module-level constants not reloading via `reload_handlers` (full Ableton
restart required).

Cross-links added:

- `docs/manual/getting-started.md` — callout at top routing contributors to dev-install before they commit to the npm path
- `docs/manual/index.md` — new "Contributing" section in the Chapters TOC
- `CLAUDE.md` — pointer in the Project section

### Carried forward to v1.22

Still deferred from the v1.21.2 audit:

- Atlas `.enriched` schema canonicalization (`stats.enriched_devices = 87`
  vs 120 YAML files vs 135 historical claim — pick one and derive the
  others at build time; add a sync_metadata gate matching JSON stats to
  YAML file count)

## 1.21.3 — Third audit-response: manual-docs drift + sync_metadata file-list widening + unicode-escape regex fix (April 24 2026)

Fourth same-day patch in 48 hours, third audit-response in 24 hours.
Audit #3 surfaced that v1.21.2's `sync_metadata` scope expansion had
added new check TYPES but didn't widen the FILE LISTS — so docs/manual
pages kept drifting (1305 devices, 135 enriched, 52 domains) while
`sync_metadata --check` passed. This patch widens the file lists AND
fixes a latent regex bug that v1.21.2's new "device" check would have
triggered with data-corrupting consequences.

No API changes. No test additions beyond what `sync_metadata` newly
enforces. No new features.

### P2 — Manual-doc atlas/domain drift (audit finding)

Three manual pages shipped with stale counts through v1.21.2 because
they weren't in the `sync_metadata` file lists for `enriched` /
`domain` / the new `device` check:

| File | Stale claim | Corrected to |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/manual/device-atlas.md` | 1305 devices / 135 enriched / 641 pack-indexed | 5264 / 120 / (claim dropped) |
| `docs/manual/index.md` | 1305 devices | 5264 |
| `docs/manual/tool-reference.md` | 1305 devices / 135 enriched / 52 domains | 5264 / 120 / 53 |

The 5 numeric substitutions (device count, enriched count, domain count)
were auto-closed by `sync_metadata --fix` once the file lists were
widened. The `641 pack-indexed` claim was manually dropped (the fixer
substitutes numbers, doesn't delete claims) — the shipped atlas has an
empty `.packs` list, so any specific pack-indexed number would be
meaningless anyway.

### Critical — Latent regex bug in `check_prose_claim` and `_fix_count`

Adding the `"device"` noun to `PROSE_CLAIM_FILES` exposed a regex
vulnerability that had existed since v1.15-era. `check_prose_claim`'s
pattern was:

```python
r"(\d+)[-\s]+(?:[A-Za-z]+\s+)?{noun}s?\b"
```

No word-boundary assertion at the start. In `manifest.json`, the em-dash
is stored as the JSON escape `\u2014`. Raw characters are
`\`, `u`, `2`, `0`, `1`, `4` — so the literal text "2014" appears
next to a space, next to "device atlas". The regex matched:

```
...\u2014 device atlas...
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
       (captures "2014", next optional word is empty, then "device")
```

Reported as `manifest.json: has '2014 device', expected '5264 device'`.
If `sync_metadata --fix` had run, it would have rewritten `\u2014`
(em-dash) to `\u5264` (CJK ideograph `剤`). The JSON would become
visually corrupted and linguistically nonsensical.

**Prior versions got away with this** because no earlier PROSE_CLAIM
noun could align adjacent to the 4-char "2014":
  - "tool" starts with `t` — no match
  - "bridge command" starts with `b` — no match
  - "enriched" starts with `e` — no match
  - "semantic move" / "analyzer tool" / "genre default" — none start with `d`

The new `"device"` noun (starts with `d`) was the first to align.
v1.21.2's extension would have shipped a corrupting `--fix` if anyone
had run it immediately.

Fix: leading `\b` assertion on all 4 regex patterns in sync_metadata
(`check_tool_count`, `check_prose_claim`, `fix_tool_count`,
`_fix_count`). Word-boundary before `\d+` means the digit must start
at a non-word-to-word transition — which excludes digits adjacent to
other word chars (like the `u` in `\u2014`).

Verified: post-fix, `check_prose_claim(noun="device")` reports only
the intended `5264 devices` in `manifest.json` — the `2014` ghost is
gone. All existing checks (tool count, bridge command, enriched, etc.)
continue to match correctly because their valid matches are always
preceded by non-word chars (space, parenthesis, start-of-string, etc.).

### `sync_metadata.py` expansion — new scope + 3 new file-list entries

Added:
  * **`get_atlas_device_count()`** + `PROSE_CLAIM_FILES["device"]`
    (threshold=1000) — enforces atlas device-count claims match
    `stats.total_devices`. Deferred from v1.21.2 because generic
    noun="device" was thought too broad; threshold=1000 filters
    historical "5 devices" mentions entirely. Enabled here based on
    audit #3 finding.
  * **`PROSE_CLAIM_FILES["enriched"]`** file list widened: added
    `docs/manual/device-atlas.md`, `docs/manual/tool-reference.md`.
    These had stale "135 enriched" while README said "120".
  * **`DOMAIN_COUNT_FILES`** file list widened: added
    `docs/manual/tool-reference.md`. Its "52 domains" had drifted
    while the rest of the repo was at 53.

New `sync_metadata --check` banner reports:
`version=1.21.3, tools=430, domains=53, bridge_cmds=31, enriched=120,
genres=4, moves=44, analyzer_tools=38, atlas_devices=5264`.

### Deferred to v1.22

- **`check_prose_claim` regex slash-prefix broadening** — still needs
  doing (would let "spectral/analyzer tools" match the "analyzer tool"
  check). Not landed in this patch because it would touch every
  existing noun and warrants its own regression test pass.
- **Atlas `.enriched` schema decision** — three definitions (87 stats,
  120 YAML files, 135 flag count). v1.21.3 standardized on 120 across
  all descriptions via widened `enriched` check, but the schema
  question is still open.
- **`dev-install` path** — still open.

### Scope stats

- 1 code fix (`sync_metadata.py` regex `\b` insertion on 4 patterns —
  prevents future unicode-escape corruption)
- 1 code expansion (`sync_metadata.py` — new `device` check type +
  file-list widening on 2 existing checks)
- 3 doc corrections auto-closed by `sync_metadata --fix` (9 numeric
  substitutions across 3 manual files) + 1 manual prose-drop (641
  pack-indexed in device-atlas.md)
- 15 version-string sites + `.amxd` binary patch (2 bytes) + `.maxpat`
  source label + `package-lock.json` (2 fields) bumped 1.21.2 → 1.21.3
- Test suite: 3124 passed, 1 skipped (unchanged — no-regression patch)

### Credits

Third external audit by the repo owner. Fourth same-day patch since
v1.20.1. Audit-to-ship pattern stable at ~2h per round.

---

## 1.21.2 — Second audit-response: atlas reconciliation + manual hygiene + sync_metadata expansion (April 24 2026)

Second same-day audit-response patch. After v1.21.1 shipped, the repo
owner ran another audit and surfaced one code bug (`AtlasManager`
reported `version="unknown"` because the atlas JSON has `.version` at
top level, not under `.meta.version`) plus four documentation drifts
(atlas claims in 11 description fields, stale "32" analyzer counts in
3 locations, reversibility overclaim in the manual, `.maxpat` source
displaying `v1.17.5`), and the meta-observation that `sync_metadata.py`
had been blind to the entire category of drift that keeps surfacing
in audit rounds.

This patch closes all five findings AND expands `sync_metadata`'s
scope so future drift of the same classes fails CI instead of requiring
another manual audit.

### P2 — `AtlasManager.version` now reads top-level `.version`

Pre-fix (`mcp_server/atlas/__init__.py:21`):

```python
self._meta = data.get("meta", {})
# ...
@property
def version(self) -> str:
    return self._meta.get("version", "unknown")
```

The shipped `device_atlas.json` has `.version = "2.0.0"` at top level,
not nested under `.meta.version`. So `self._meta` was always `{}` and
`.version` always returned `"unknown"`. Fixed by reading both locations
with top-level winning; `.meta.version` preserved as fallback for any
internal/dev atlas using the older schema. After fix:
`AtlasManager.version` returns `"2.0.0"` on the shipped atlas.

### P2 — Atlas description claims: 1305 devices → 5264, drop "641 pack-indexed"

The "1305 devices" claim was false in every public surface (actual
shipped JSON has `stats.total_devices = 5264`). The "641 pack-indexed"
claim was meaningless — the shipped atlas has an empty `.packs` list;
device-side pack count via `.devices[*].pack` field is 50 across 13
unique pack names (not 641 or 655).

Updated 11 surfaces: `README.md` (5 hits), `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
`package.json`, `server.json`, `manifest.json` (2 hits), `marketplace.json`,
`Codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `claude-plugin/plugin.json`,
`livepilot-core/SKILL.md`, `livepilot-core/references/overview.md` (2 hits).

"120 enriched" kept — defensible as the YAML enrichment file count
(120 files on disk). The `stats.enriched_devices` value (87) and the
`.enriched=true` flag count (135) are two other valid definitions; the
three-way divergence is a schema question for v1.22+ scope, not a
drift fix here.

### P2 — Manual analyzer-tool count 32 → 38

`docs/manual/getting-started.md:256` and `livepilot/skills/livepilot-release/SKILL.md`
(3 lines) still said "32 spectral/analyzer tools" despite the actual
`@mcp.tool` count in `analyzer.py` being 38. Corrected.

### P2 — `.maxpat` source label v1.17.5 → v1.21.2

`m4l_device/LivePilot_Analyzer.maxpat:1611` had a stale visible version
label `"text": "v1.17.5"`. The compiled `.amxd` had been binary-patched
to the correct version across releases, but the source patch Max uses
when someone opens/rebuilds the device never got updated. Fixed.

### P3 — Manual reversibility language hedge

`docs/manual/index.md:31` said "All 430 tools... reversible with undo"
— the README was hedged in v1.21.1 but the manual missed. Corrected
with matching language: Live-session mutations route through Ableton's
undo stack; side effects outside the Live project (Splice downloads,
memory/ledger writes, installer actions, atlas scans, filesystem writes)
persist beyond undo.

### `sync_metadata.py` expansion — converts this drift class into CI failures

Added to close the audit-memory gap that made v1.21.0, v1.21.1, and
now v1.21.2 each need a manual sweep:

- **`check_lockfile_version(version)`** — asserts `package-lock.json`
  root `.version` matches `package.json`. Would have caught the
  lockfile-stuck-at-1.17.5 drift at CI time from pre-v1.18 onwards.
- **`PROSE_CLAIM_FILES["semantic move"]`** — enforces every registered
  "N semantic moves" claim matches `registry.count()` (currently 44).
  Would have caught v1.21.0's "43 semantic moves" drift at CI time.
- **`PROSE_CLAIM_FILES["analyzer tool"]`** — enforces "N analyzer tools"
  claims match `@mcp.tool` count in `analyzer.py` (currently 38).
  Catches plain-form drift; "spectral/analyzer tools" slashed variants
  bypass the current `check_prose_claim` regex's optional-word prefix
  (noted in an inline comment — left for a future patch to broaden).

`sync_metadata --check` banner now reports 2 new counts:
`moves=44, analyzer_tools=38` alongside the previous 6.

### Deferred to v1.22

- **`sync_metadata.py` atlas-stats check** — catching drift in
  "5264 devices" or "87 enriched" claims requires either a noun-specific
  regex (generic "device" is too broad — false-positives on every
  historical "5 devices" mention) or a different check strategy.
  Worth doing but nontrivial.
- **`check_prose_claim` regex broadening** to catch slashed compounds
  like "spectral/analyzer tools". Current regex's `(?:[A-Za-z]+\s+)?`
  prefix misses `spectral/` because the slash breaks the character class.
- **Atlas JSON schema decision** — whether `stats.enriched_devices`,
  `.enriched=true` flag count, or YAML file count is THE canonical
  "enriched" number. Picking one + renaming fields ends the three-way
  ambiguity.

### Credits

Second external audit by the repo owner, performed ~30 min after
v1.21.1 shipped. Same-day patch #2 ships ~2 hours after audit receipt
(matches the v1.20.1 / v1.21.1 same-day-hotfix precedent — this is the
third such same-day patch in 48 hours).

### Scope stats

- 1 code fix (`mcp_server/atlas/__init__.py` — `AtlasManager` reads
  top-level `.version`)
- 1 code expansion (`scripts/sync_metadata.py` — 3 new checks:
  move_count, analyzer_tool_count, lockfile_version)
- 4 doc corrections (atlas claims across 11 files + analyzer count in
  4 files + reversibility hedge + .maxpat label)
- 15 version-string sites + `.amxd` binary patch (2 bytes) +
  package-lock.json (2 fields) bumped 1.21.1 → 1.21.2
- Test suite: 3124 passed, 1 skipped (unchanged — this is a
  no-regression patch; the AtlasManager fix makes a previously-
  untested code path produce the right answer).

---

## 1.21.1 — Audit-response patch: experiment-commit safety + doc hygiene + lockfile (April 24 2026)

Small patch release responding to an external audit of v1.21.0 performed
the same day it shipped. The audit surfaced one real safety bug
(commit_experiment status allowlist was an exclusion list when the
intent was an inclusion list) plus several doc-consistency drifts.
No new features. No API changes beyond the tightened commit_experiment
contract. v1.21.0 callers already doing the right thing
(run_experiment → commit the ranked winner) continue to work unchanged.

### P1 — commit_experiment only accepts `status='evaluated'`

Pre-fix (v1.21.0 and all prior versions with commit_experiment), the
status check was an EXCLUSION list:

```python
if target.status in ("rejected", "analytical", "failed"):
    return {"error": ...}
```

Blocks 3 statuses; implicitly allows the other 6 — including `pending`,
`running`, `discarded`, and `interesting_but_failed`. Those branches
can't be ranked by `compare_experiments()`, but `commit_experiment`
would accept them as long as a compiled plan was attached. The code's
own inline comment already described the correct contract ("only
status='evaluated' branches are ranking candidates"); the implementation
had the wrong polarity. The fix flips it to an INCLUSION check:

```python
if target.status != "evaluated":
    return {"error": ...}
```

Error message updated to enumerate all 9 possible statuses and explain
which state each represents (pending/running = not yet evaluated;
rejected/analytical/failed = classifier exclusions; committed =
already committed; discarded = explicitly thrown out;
interesting_but_failed = exploration-audit only).

Why this matters: v1.21.0's `commit_experiment` ledger writer records
every commit into `SessionLedger` where anti-repetition filters read
it. Without the tighter status check, a caller bypassing the ranking
layer could pollute the ledger with entries the system explicitly
classified as non-winners — degrading anti-repetition signal quality.

**Regression tests added (4)** in `tests/test_commit_experiment_ledger.py`:
`test_commit_on_pending_branch_rejects`,
`test_commit_on_running_branch_rejects`,
`test_commit_on_discarded_branch_rejects`,
`test_commit_on_interesting_but_failed_branch_rejects`. All FAILED
pre-fix (reproducing the audit's finding), all PASS post-fix.

### P1 — package-lock.json bumped 1.17.5 → 1.21.1

Lockfile's root `.version` and `.packages[""].version` had been stale
at 1.17.5 since before v1.18. `npm publish` doesn't read these fields
(it reads package.json), so the npm registry was always correct — but
the repo-local lockfile misled local `npm install` workflows and any
release-check tooling that compared package.json vs lockfile. Fixed by
surgical replace on the 2 stale strings; no dependency tree
regeneration (keeps dep versions identical to v1.21.0).

### P2 — Analyzer tool count: 32/33 → 38 (actual)

README.md previously said "32 spectral/analyzer tools" in one place
and "38 analyzer tools" in another — inconsistent within the same file.
`docs/M4L_BRIDGE.md` said "33 MCP tools in the analyzer domain" in two
places. Actual `@mcp.tool` count in `mcp_server/tools/analyzer.py` is
**38** (grep-verified). All stale 32/33 refs corrected to 38.

### P2 — Reversibility language hedge

README's header NOTE block said "Everything is reversible with undo,"
which is too strong. Live-session mutations (clips, devices, mixer,
arrangement) do route through Ableton's undo stack and are reversible
— but Splice downloads, memory/ledger writes, installer actions, atlas
scans, and filesystem writes persist beyond undo. Hedged the language
to reflect this.

### Deferred to v1.22

Audit-surfaced items that aren't patch-release material:

- **Atlas statistics reconciliation.** Docs claim "1305 devices / 120
  enriched / 641 pack-indexed" across 9 description fields, but the
  shipped `device_atlas.json` has 5264 devices and 135 entries with
  `.enriched` truthy. The "1305" number appears to be a long-stale
  cargo-culted count. Requires deciding whether `.devices` contains
  duplicates, what the canonical "enriched" definition is, and
  whether to restructure atlas JSON or fix the readers that look for
  `.meta.version`. v1.22 scope.
- **`sync_metadata` expansion** to check package-lock.json project
  version, semantic-move count via `registry.count()`, and
  analyzer-tool count via grep on `analyzer.py`. Would convert this
  entire class of drift into CI failures.
- **Dev-install path** for local contributors hitting missing
  `soundfile` / `scipy` / `pretty_midi` / `pytest_asyncio` deps during
  bare-python local runs. CI has these installed via requirements.txt.

### Credits

External audit performed same day v1.21.0 shipped. Findings

## 1.21.0 — Consolidation: experiment ledger + preset library + record-readiness + reader audit (April 24 2026)

Consolidation release closing five items from the v1.20 plan §12 non-goals
that were tractable in a 2-session scope. Adds 1 new semantic move + 1
major-tool auto-ledger-write + minimal preset-library infrastructure +
a store-purpose audit that turns the v1.20 director-SKILL fix into a
codebase-wide invariant, all gated behind a test-first wire-format
parity extension that caught 1 pre-v1.20 drift bug and closed the
audit window.

Registry: 43 → 44 moves. Test suite: 3043 → 3118 pass (+75 across all
chunks). Wire-format parity suite: 10 → 44 scenarios. Zero regressions.

### New semantic moves (1)

- **`configure_record_readiness`** (performance family, low risk, protects
  `signal_integrity=0.7`)
  - seed_args: `{track_index, armed, exclusive?}`
  - Non-exclusive: single step `set_track_arm(track_index, arm=armed)` — note
    the wire-format key is `arm`, not `armed` (the MCP tool accepts `armed`
    as an ergonomic kwarg but renames to `arm` before send_command; the
    remote_command backend bypasses that rename).
  - Exclusive (`exclusive=True` + `armed=True`): N+1 step plan —
    `set_track_arm(arm=False)` for every other regular track, then
    `set_track_arm(target, arm=True)` for the target. Emulates Ableton's
    exclusive-arm mode manually because `song.exclusive_arm` has no
    Python setter in Live 12.4 (pre-existing v1.20.3 Remote Script bug
    surfaced during v1.21 live-test pre-flight — see plan correction #6).
    Requires `session_info.tracks` (automatically built by
    `apply_semantic_move`).
  - Rejects `exclusive=True + armed=False` (contradictory), missing `armed`
    seed_arg, and negative `track_index` (return tracks can't be armed
    per Ableton's handler at `remote_script/LivePilot/tracks.py:261`).
  - Closes the one tech_debt entry seeded during v1.20 live test 6.

### Experiment-engine ledger writer

- **`commit_experiment`** now writes to `SessionLedger` after a successful
  commit, mirroring v1.20's `apply_semantic_move` pattern (commit `0b3489b`).
  Anti-repetition filters downstream now see experiment commits the same
  way they see direct semantic-move applies.
  - `engine` tag reflects branch SOURCE (not escalation success): `"composer"`
    when `target.seed.source == "composer"`, else `"experiment"`. A composer-
    sourced branch that fell back to scaffold execution is still
    `engine=composer` — the escalation-success detail lives in
    `target.evaluation["composer_escalation"]`.
  - `move_class` via `_infer_move_family(target)`: `seed.family` when set,
    else inspect first compiled_plan step's tool via `_TOOL_TO_FAMILY`
    lookup, else default `"mix"`.
  - `actions` = one entry per ok row in `commit_result["execution_log"]`
    (the router's actual execution record — captures the post-escalation
    plan when composer escalation fired).
  - Response gains `ledger_entry_id` field (same pattern as
    `apply_semantic_move`). Best-effort — a ledger-write exception is logged
    and swallowed so the commit never fails on a bookkeeping path.

### Minimal affordance preset library

- New path `mcp_server/affordances/` with loader (`presets.py`), schema
  validator (`_schema.py`), and 3 seed YAML files:
  - `reverb.yaml` — preset `dub-cathedral` (Basic Channel-adjacent huge
    space; Decay 0.85, Room 0.95, Dry/Wet 0.40, Predelay 0.45, Diffusion 0.80)
  - `delay.yaml` — preset `ping-pong-dub` (dotted 8th, feedback 0.45,
    HP+LP filtered)
  - `auto-filter.yaml` — preset `slow-sweep` (LP type, bar-long LFO,
    moderate resonance)
- `configure_device` compiler gained optional `preset` + `device_slug`
  seed_args (additive — v1.20 callers unaffected). Merge: preset resolves
  first, explicit `param_overrides` win on per-key conflict (last-write-wins).
  v1.21 requires explicit `device_slug` when `preset` is used; v1.22
  adds class_name → slug auto-inference.
- `livepilot-creative-director/references/phase-6-execution.md` §Affordance-
  preset resolution rewritten to document the live import path and the
  three dispatch patterns (preset reference, preset + explicit override,
  fallback to Python resolve).

### Wire-format parity retroactive gate

- `tests/test_compiler_wire_format_parity.py` extended from 10 to 44
  scenarios (10 v1.20 + 33 pre-v1.20 + 1 new `configure_record_readiness`).
  Gate surfaced **1 pre-v1.20 drift pattern** affecting 7 moves:
  `create_chaos_modulator`, `create_feedback_resonator`,
  `create_wavefolder_effect`, `create_bitcrusher_effect`,
  `create_karplus_string`, `create_stochastic_texture`, `create_fdn_reverb`
  all shipped with a `find_and_load_device` plan_template emitting
  `{"query": "Wonder X"}` but no `track_index`. The `remote_command`
  backend bypasses MCP normalization, so Ableton's handler threw
  `KeyError` on `params["track_index"]` — broken at runtime since
  pre-v1.20, caught now.
- Fix: `device_creation_compilers.py::_compile_device_creation` threads
  `track_index` from `seed_args` into `find_and_load_device` steps.
  Plan templates updated from `{"query": ...}` to `{"device_name": ...}`
  across all 7 Device Forge moves.
- Variant-B' consideration (>3 drift bugs → pause v1.21, ship patch):
  all 7 failures were one pattern in one file, fixable in one commit.
  Path B (inline fix as part of Task 1.1.5a) taken — single-pattern
  single-file fixes are exactly what Task 1.1.5a was written for.
  See `docs/plans/v1.21-impl-status.md` §3 for the decision log.

### Store-purpose reader audit

- Every file in `mcp_server/` that imports `SessionLedger` or calls
  `memory_list` / `get_session_memory` now carries a
  `# store_purpose: <purpose>` comment naming its intent.
- Allowed purposes (closed set): `writer`, `anti_repetition`,
  `audit_readonly`, `technique_library`, `session_observations`,
  `escape_hatch_log`, `mcp_tool_definition`.
- **`tests/test_ledger_readers.py`** new (5 test cases): enforces the
  annotation contract at CI, AND guards against any file annotated
  `anti_repetition` also calling `memory_list` — which would be the
  latent v1.20 store-confusion bug (director SKILL originally pointed
  at `memory_list` for recency; `memory_list` reads the persistent
  technique library, not the action ledger).
- Audit was clean across the entire `mcp_server` tree — no anti-repetition
  caller was found reading the wrong store. The audit is purely
  documentation contracts enforced at CI.

### Plan corrections applied during execution (6, logged in impl-status doc)

Documented for future release planners in `docs/plans/v1.21-impl-status.md`:

1. **Baseline drift** — v1.20.2 and v1.20.3 shipped between plan-write and
   execution; all version-string literals in the plan needed `1.20.1 →
   1.20.3` remapping.
2. **Wire-format drift in device_creation** — plan_templates emitted
   `{"query": ...}`; handler requires `{"track_index", "device_name"}`.
3. **`set_track_arm` wire format** — plan §3.1 used `{"armed": ...}`;
   handler reads `params["arm"]`. MCP tool renames `armed → arm` before
   send_command; remote_command backend bypasses the rename.
4. **`set_exclusive_arm` shape** — plan §3.1 assumed a per-track signature
   `(track_index=...)`; handler is a global mode toggle taking
   `{"enabled": bool}`.
5. **Return-track arm rejection** — plan's test expected negative
   `track_index` to succeed; handler raises `ValueError: "Cannot arm a
   return track"`. Corrected test pins compile-time rejection.
6. **`set_exclusive_arm` is broken in Live 12.4 LOM** — live-test pre-flight
   (2026-04-24) surfaced that `song.exclusive_arm` is a property WITHOUT a
   Python setter in Live 12.4's Remote Script API. The v1.20.3 handler's
   direct assignment `song.exclusive_arm = bool(...)` errors with
   "property of 'Song' object has no setter". v1.21's
   `configure_record_readiness` exclusive-mode now emulates the behavior
   manually (disarm-all-others + arm-target loop) — correctness is
   identical, works in any Live version. The broken v1.20.3
   `set_exclusive_arm` handler is LEFT AS-IS for potential future fix
   (when/if Ableton re-exposes the setter, or someone finds a LOM method
   alternative); it's tracked as an independent bug in the Remote Script.

### Non-goals (deferred)

- **Hard cutover of the escape hatch.** v1.22+ target, conditional on
  zero `tech_debt` log entries accumulating in one month of production.
- **Standard / Deep preset catalog.** v1.22+. Minimal library from v1.21
  proves the loader; catalog fills in after real-usage signal.
- **class_name → slug auto-inference** for the preset library. v1.22+.
- **Pre-v1.20 move compiler refactors** beyond the 1 drift fix. v1.22+.
- **New move families beyond the canonical 7.** The performance family
  already exists; `configure_record_readiness` joins it.
- **Taste-graph integration for preset ranking.** v1.22+ once the catalog
  exists.

### Scope stats

- 7 atomic commits on `v1.21.0-dev` (fix + gate + 4 feature + refactor + release)
- 28 files changed, +1933 / -63 lines
- 3 new test files (commit_experiment_ledger, performance_moves,
  affordance_presets, ledger_readers) + 1 doc (impl-status)
- 1 new package (`mcp_server/affordances/`) + 3 YAML seed files
- 15 version-string sites bumped + `.amxd` binary patch (2 bytes)
- 10 files annotated with `# store_purpose:`

## 1.20.3 — Automated analyzer pre-flight (April 24 2026)

Micro-release closing one class of operator error that broke the v1.20.1
five-project live-test campaign: the LLM operator had a clear memory
instruction to load `LivePilot_Analyzer` on master at the start of a
fresh Ableton session but missed it in 5 of 5 projects — producing
basic mixes instead of the intended mix-polish outcomes because every
analyzer-gated move (`tighten_low_end`, `sculpt_midrange`,
`balance_stereo_image`, etc.) silently degraded. Fixed forward with a
new idempotent pre-flight tool + Director skill wiring.

### Added

**New tool: `ensure_analyzer_on_master`** (`mcp_server/tools/analyzer.py`).
Idempotent pre-flight that loads `LivePilot_Analyzer.amxd` on master
when missing, no-ops when already loaded. Returns one of:
- `already_loaded` (with `is_last_on_master`, `duplicate_count`)
- `loaded` (first-time load from Ableton browser)
- `install_required` (device not in browser — actionable hint points at
  `install_m4l_device`)
- `failed` (any other error)

Post-load report surfaces the CLAUDE.md invariant "LivePilot_Analyzer
must be LAST on master" via `is_last_on_master: bool` and warns when
violated. Duplicate-count warning covers the edge case of multiple
analyzers on the master chain.

Safe to call every turn — subsequent calls short-circuit via one
`get_master_track` read. Tool count: 429 → 430. 6 new contract tests
covering already-loaded, missing-loads, install-required,
duplicate-handling, is-last warning, and two-call idempotence.

### Changed

**Director Phase 1** (`livepilot-creative-director/SKILL.md`). Added
`ensure_analyzer_on_master` at the top of the "Ground" reads as a
REQUIRED call, ahead of `get_session_info`. Wording explicitly connects
the step to the failure it prevents so future agents don't rationalize
skipping it: "Skipping it is how the v1.20.1 live-test campaign
produced basic mixes — the analyzer-gated moves degrade silently when
there's no master spectrum to read."

### Notes

No breaking changes. Calling code that assumed the analyzer was loaded
continues to work; the new tool adds an explicit pre-flight path.
`install_m4l_device` contract unchanged.

---

## 1.20.2 — 5 bugs + 1 race condition from the live-test campaign (April 24 2026)

Patch release fixing every issue surfaced during the v1.20.1 five-project
live-test campaign documented at `~/Desktop/DREAM AI/demo Project/REPORT.md`.
Each fix landed as its own atomic commit with TDD contract tests. Full
test suite: 2985 → 3037 pass (+52 new tests), zero regressions.

### Fixes

**🐛 #1 — Device Forge: all 7 `create_*` moves ship broken (CRITICAL).**
Each move's `plan_template` emitted `generate_m4l_effect` WITHOUT the
required `gen_code` argument, so every move failed with `missing 1
required positional argument: 'gen_code'` in explore mode. The 7
GenExpr templates already existed in `mcp_server/device_forge/
templates.py` (lorenz_attractor, wavefolder, bitcrusher, etc.) but
weren't wired. Fix: `device_creation_compilers._MOVE_TO_TEMPLATE`
routes each move_id to its template and the compiler injects `gen_code`
at compile time. (commit `61abbeb`)

**🐛 #2 — Sample family: `{sample_file_path}` template placeholder leaked
to compiled plans.** `_resolve_sample_path` returned a literal
`"{sample_file_path}"` string when the kernel had no path set —
falling through to `load_sample_to_simpler` with a non-existent file.
Fix: resolver now reads `seed_args["file_path"]` (v1.20 convention),
falls back to legacy `kernel["sample_file_path"]` (wonder_mode
setter), returns `None` on miss. Each of the 6 sample moves rejects
with a non-executable plan + actionable warning when path is None.
(commit `26de33c`)

**🐛 #3 — Analyzer-gated moves hard-fail their mutation steps.**
`tighten_low_end` and `make_kick_bass_lock` emitted
`get_master_spectrum` as a pre-read. When the analyzer wasn't loaded
on master, step 0 failed and `execute_plan_steps_async`
`stop_on_failure=True` halted the plan BEFORE the mutation steps
(bass volume change) ran. Fix: general `CompiledStep.optional: bool`
field + router skip-and-continue on optional failures; affected
compilers tag their analyzer pre-reads as `optional=True`. The
mechanism is reusable for any future soft-gated diagnostic step.
(commit `5f9f0ae`)

**🐛 #4 — `batch_set_parameters` silently snaps quantized enum params.**
Beat Repeat's `Gate=0.3` and `Variation=0.8` became `Gate=0` / `Variation=0`
— valid snaps for quantized enum params, but the response gave callers
no signal that their intent was discarded. Fix: `batch_set_parameters`
post-processes Ableton's response, comparing requested vs returned
values with 1e-5 epsilon; appends a `snapped_params` list when
mismatches occur, each carrying `{name, requested, actual,
display_value, value_string}`. Empty list = nothing snapped.
(commit `b472976`)

**🐛 #5 — `create_midi_track` can create duplicate-name tracks silently.**
When `set_track_name(2, "Pad")` runs and then `create_midi_track(index=2,
name="Pad")` shifts the existing track to index 4 while retaining its
name, the session ends up with two "Pad" tracks. Downstream
`find_tracks_by_role` matches both and mix moves apply twice. Fix:
`create_midi_track` and `create_audio_track` now pre-query session
for tracks with the requested name and stamp the response with
`name_collision: bool` + `existing_tracks_with_same_name: list[int]`.
Doesn't block creation — callers decide whether to rename or accept.
(commit `69bc545`)

**🔁 Race condition — "Connection closed by Ableton" on UI transitions.**
Observed 3× during the campaign: after `Cmd+N` (new live set), the
next MCP call would drop with `Connection closed by Ableton`.
Ableton's Remote Script briefly rejects commands during UI state
transitions. Fix: `connection.send_command` now retries once with
400ms backoff on that specific error, reconnecting between attempts.
Timeouts still raise immediately (mutation-duplicate risk). Retry
budget capped at 1 — second failure raises cleanly. (commit `cf019d5`)

### Scope of the campaign

See `~/Desktop/DREAM AI/demo Project/` for the 5 `.als` files, `PLAN.md`,
and `REPORT.md` that produced this backlog:
- `01 basic-channel-dub.als` — dub techno @ 130
- `02 dilla-swing-drums.als` — hip-hop @ 90 with MIDI-native swing
- `03 opn-wonder-texture.als` — ambient @ 70 (Device Forge failure noted)
- `04 aphex-destruction.als` — IDM @ 155 (Beat Repeat snap noted)
- `05 mix-polish.als` — house @ 125 (analyzer-gate failure noted)

### CI status

All 9 CI jobs expected green: python-tests × {ubuntu, macos, windows} ×
{3.11, 3.12}, metadata-drift, amxd-freeze-drift, js-entrypoint.

### Non-goals

No new moves in v1.20.2 — every change is a fix to existing surfaces.
v1.21 remains the consolidation release (see `docs/plans/v1.21-structural-plan.md`).

## 1.20.1 — CI hardening: Windows UTF-8 encoding + .amxd ping drift (April 24 2026)

Patch release fixing CI regressions that v1.20.0 shipped with (caught
by the actual CI run post-tag). No runtime behavior changes — tests
pass on every platform, and the .amxd ping now matches the repo
version. Zero new tests (both fixes are mechanical), zero regressions.

### Fixes

- **Windows-only `UnicodeDecodeError` in `tests/test_creative_director.py`.**
  27 bare `Path.read_text()` calls used the locale default encoding.
  On Windows that's cp1252, which chokes on the em-dashes (—), arrows
  (→), and smart quotes v1.20 added to `SKILL.md` and the new
  `phase-6-execution.md` reference. All 27 calls now pass
  `encoding="utf-8"` explicitly. Cross-platform hygiene, applies
  beyond the trigger case — any future markdown additions with
  non-ASCII chars are now safe on Windows.

- **`LivePilot_Analyzer.amxd` ping reported v1.17.5 for 9 releases.**
  The CI `amxd-freeze-drift` job has been red since v1.18.0 because
  nobody re-froze the .amxd in Max Editor after the JS source bumps.
  Users of v1.18.0-v1.20.0 got `{ok: true, version: "1.17.5"}` from
  the bridge ping regardless of the installed version. Per
  `feedback_amxd_safe_binary_patch` memory, same-length version
  strings can be patched in-place without Max re-export. Both
  occurrences in the binary updated to 1.20.1 (file size unchanged);
  the JS source `livepilot_bridge.js` VERSION constant also bumped
  so future clean freezes stay consistent.

### CI status after this release

| Job | Pre-v1.20.1 | v1.20.1 |
|---|---|---|
| python-tests (ubuntu, macos) × {3.11, 3.12} | ✓ | ✓ |
| python-tests (windows) × {3.11, 3.12} | ✗ UnicodeDecodeError | ✓ |
| metadata-drift | ✓ | ✓ |
| amxd-freeze-drift | ✗ stuck at 1.17.5 | ✓ |

## 1.20.0 — Item C phased cutover: 10 new semantic moves + Director Phase 6 rewrite (April 24 2026)

Implements the plan in `docs/plans/v1.20-structural-plan.md`. Ships 10
new semantic moves across four family-themed commits, rewrites the
creative director's Phase 6 to make `apply_semantic_move` the default
execution surface with a documented + tracked escape hatch, and hardens
three systemic issues surfaced during live pressure testing. Registry:
33 → 43 moves across the same 7 canonical families. Full test suite:
2858 → 2985 pass (+127, zero regressions).

### New semantic moves (10 total)

**Routing family (`mcp_server/semantic_moves/routing_moves.py`):**
- `build_send_chain` (device_creation, medium risk) — load an ordered
  chain of devices onto a return track; the Basic Channel / dub-techno
  / ambient send-architecture primitive. `protect: low_end=0.6`.
- `configure_send_architecture` (mix, low risk) — set send levels
  across multiple source tracks in one move.
- `set_track_routing` (mix, medium risk) — rewire a track's output
  routing, e.g. "Sends Only" for bus architectures.

**Device-mutation family:**
- `configure_device` (sound_design, low risk) — bulk-configure N
  parameters on an existing device in a single undoable move. Takes
  `param_overrides: dict` (preset library deferred to v1.21).
- `remove_device` (sound_design, medium risk, protects
  `signal_integrity=0.9`) — destructive removal with a required
  `reason` string auto-logged to session memory for audit.

**Content family:**
- `load_chord_source` (sound_design, low risk) — create+voice+name a
  MIDI chord clip in one move; feeds `build_send_chain` return chains.
- `create_drum_rack_pad` (device_creation, low risk) — add one pad to
  a Drum Rack, Dilla-style kit-at-a-time.

**Metadata family:**
- `configure_groove` (arrangement, low risk) — the Dilla-swing
  primitive; assigns a groove + optionally tunes its timing_amount.
- `set_scene_metadata` (arrangement, low risk) — conditional
  name/color/tempo in one move.
- `set_track_metadata` (mix, low risk) — bundled rename + color, since
  the two are always paired in Phase 6 usage.

### Director SKILL — Phase 6 rewrite

- **Decision table (authoritative):** each uncovered-pattern row now
  points at a specific v1.20 move (e.g. "Set multiple params on a
  device" → `configure_device`). 10 NEW rows marked explicitly.
- **Default execution surface**: `apply_semantic_move` +
  `commit_experiment`, replacing the pre-v1.20 "raw tools + manual
  `add_session_memory(move_executed)` marker" pattern.
- **Escape hatch policy** (v1.20 transitional state): when no move
  covers the pattern, raw-tool execution is permitted only with the
  three-call discipline — the raw call, an `add_session_memory(
  category="move_executed")` marker, AND an `add_session_memory(
  category="tech_debt")` log naming the uncovered pattern. Both
  categories are mandatory; they serve different consumers (ledger
  vs release planning).
- **New reference doc** `phase-6-execution.md` (349 lines) — full
  contract (seed_args, compiled steps, risk/protect, typical caller)
  for each of the 10 moves, plus a worked escape-hatch example.

### Architectural extension (commit 1)

`apply_semantic_move(args: dict)` and `preview_semantic_move(args: dict)`
now accept user seed parameters that flow into the compiler's kernel as
`kernel["seed_args"]`. Pre-v1.20 moves are unaffected (they read only
from `session_info`); the new routing/content/metadata moves read from
`seed_args` for user targets like `return_track_index`, `device_chain`,
`notes`, `track_index`, etc.

### Live-test hardening (bugs caught during the 6 pressure-test gate)

**Wire-format compiler fix.** `configure_device` and `set_track_routing`
initially emitted MCP-tool-input keys (`parameter_name`,
`output_routing_type`) which the MCP tool layer would normalize — but
compiled plans use the `remote_command` backend that goes directly to
`ableton.send_command()`, bypassing the MCP tool entirely. Ableton's
Remote Script reads wire-format keys (`name_or_index`, `output_type`)
exclusively. Fix: both compilers emit wire format. New regression suite
`tests/test_compiler_wire_format_parity.py` — 10 parametrized cases,
one per v1.20 move, asserting every compiled step's params match the
Remote Script handler's actual key inventory.

**Automatic ledger write.** `apply_semantic_move` in explore mode now
writes a LedgerEntry to `SessionLedger` (family, intent, per-step
actions, provisional `kept=True`, `score = success_fraction`). Returns
a `ledger_entry_id` in the response so callers can correlate with
post-hoc `evaluate_move` evaluation. Pre-v1.20 docs pointed
anti-repetition at `memory_list` which actually reads the persistent
technique library — wrong store. Director SKILL now points at
`get_action_ledger_summary`. `commit_experiment` auto-ledger is v1.21
scope.

**Session memory categories.** `_VALID_CATEGORIES` in
`mcp_server/memory/session_memory.py` now includes the three v1.20
director Phase 6 categories: `move_executed`, `tech_debt`, and
`override`. Pre-v1.20 categories preserved (backward compat);
arbitrary strings still rejected. 7 new contract tests.

### New tests (+127 across the release)

- `tests/test_registry_uniqueness.py` (4) — guard against dict-insertion
  collisions; baseline move count.
- `tests/test_apply_semantic_move_args.py` (13) — seed_args threading +
  ledger-write contract for each mode.
- `tests/test_routing_moves.py` (21) — per-move + cross-family.
- `tests/test_device_mutation_moves.py` (15).
- `tests/test_content_moves.py` (14).
- `tests/test_metadata_moves.py` (15).
- `tests/test_director_move_coverage.py` (8) — SKILL ↔ registry drift
  detection; phase-6-execution.md contract coverage.
- `tests/test_compiler_wire_format_parity.py` (10) — wire-format
  invariant across all 10 v1.20 moves.
- `tests/test_v1_20_session_memory_categories.py` (7) — allowlist
  contract.
- Various in-place additions (execution_router / mcp_dispatch
  classifier entries for `add_session_memory` and `add_drum_rack_pad`;
  test_device_creation_moves invariant generalized to admit
  device-loading moves alongside Device Forge moves).

### Live pressure-test results (the 6 plan §5 scenarios, all passing)

1. `build_send_chain` on Return A with Echo + Auto Filter + Hybrid
   Reverb — 4 steps, 4 successes.
2. `configure_device` on the Reverb with dub-cathedral overrides
   (Decay 25.5s, Room Size 339.89, Dry/Wet 40%, Predelay 8.19ms,
   Diffusion 77%) — 5 params set in one batch_set_parameters call.
3. `configure_send_architecture` on track 0 → Send A at 0.4 — single
   step, success.
4. `load_chord_source` on track 0 slot 0 with a C minor 7 voicing —
   create_clip + add_notes + set_clip_name, 3/3 success.
5. 4 moves in sequence → `get_action_ledger_summary` returns 4 entries
   (engine=semantic_moves, mix+arrangement families), zero `tech_debt`
   entries — automatic ledger write confirmed end-to-end.
6. Escape hatch: raw `set_track_arm(track=2, armed=true)` + both
   mandatory `add_session_memory` markers; `get_session_memory(
   category="tech_debt")` returns the log entry as expected.

### Scope / non-goals

Not in v1.20, explicitly deferred:
- Hard cutover (closing the escape hatch). v1.21 target, conditional
  on zero `tech_debt` entries over one month of production use.
- Preset YAML library for `configure_device`. The move's
  `param_overrides` dict already accepts a pre-resolved preset; the
  library is the layer that produces those dicts.
- `commit_experiment` automatic ledger write. Tracked as tech-debt.
- Rewriting the existing 33 moves to a new shape. v1.22+.
- Director Phase 6 compiler that picks moves automatically from user
  intent. Current Phase 6 is user/director-selected; auto-selection
  is a separate feature.

## 1.19.1 — v1.19.0 polish (April 24 2026)

Patch release addressing the three "Known gaps" documented at the
end of the v1.19.0 CHANGELOG entry. All three were cosmetic or
observability issues — no correctness changes. 3 new tests + 1
pre-existing test tolerance widened. Test suite 2854 → 2858 pass.

### Fixes

- **#1 `baseline_transport` not exposed via `compare_experiments`.**
  The field was populated internally on `ExperimentSet` (verified
  by unit tests) but `compare_experiments`' MCP response omitted
  it — operators had no surface-level path to verify the
  between-branch drift fix was actually firing. Now present on
  every response (`None` when the experiment hasn't run yet, so
  clients can rely on key presence and check
  `result["baseline_transport"] is None` without `in` guards).

- **#2 Tempo warning midpoint rounds to int while range is exact.**
  Pre-v1.19.1 `compile_hybrid_brief` with disjoint tempo ranges
  reported warning text "midpoint 108 BPM" while the returned
  range was 105-110 (centered on 107.5). Two rounding
  conventions — human-facing text rounded to `:0f`, machine-facing
  range kept the exact float. Fix: `:g` format in the warning
  produces the shortest accurate representation (107.5 stays
  "107.5"; 128.0 renders as "128") so both surfaces agree.

- **#3 `weights` display full float precision.**
  Uniform 3-packet hybrids rendered weights as
  `0.3333333333333333` — noisy output that contrasted with
  `evaluation_bias.target_dimensions` values already being
  rounded to 4 decimal places. Weights are now rounded to 4 dp
  in the response dict (`[0.3333, 0.3333, 0.3333]`). Internal
  computation still uses full precision; only the output is
  rounded.

### Tests added

- `test_compare_experiments_surfaces_baseline_transport` — round-trip
  seed a distinctive baseline on ExperimentSet, assert
  `compare_experiments` surfaces all fields (is_playing, song_time,
  track_states, captured_at_ms).
- `test_compare_experiments_baseline_none_when_not_captured` — fresh
  experiment has `baseline_transport: None` in the response rather
  than an omitted key.
- `test_tempo_warning_midpoint_matches_range_center` — regex-parse
  the warning text and assert its numeric midpoint matches the
  returned range's center within 0.01 BPM.
- `test_weights_rounded_to_4dp` — uniform 3-packet weights must be
  representable at 4 dp precision (`round(w, 4) == w`).

Test suite: 2858 pass, 1 skipped. Zero regressions. `sync_metadata
--check` clean.

## 1.19.0 — Experiment baseline + hybrid packet compilation (April 24 2026)

Minor version bump. Ships two of the three open items documented in
`docs/plans/v1.19-structural-plan.md`. Item C (full architectural
routing of director Phase 6 through `apply_semantic_move`) is
deferred to v1.20 per the plan's blast-radius rationale.

Both items shipped under strict TDD: 52 new unit tests, zero
regressions across the 2854-test suite. Both items live-tested in
production (real Ableton session, Live 12.4.0, 13 live-test
scenarios green).

### Item A — Experiment baseline transport snapshot/restore

Live-verified in v1.18.0 Test 8: running a 3-branch experiment
sequentially produced inconsistent `before_snapshot` values
because playback position, mute/solo/arm, and playing-clip state
drifted across branches. `undo()` reverts command history but
doesn't guarantee transport state is identical when each branch's
`before_snapshot` fires. Track_meters[0].level values of 0.764 /
0.000 / 0.873 across three branches rendered the before/after
comparisons meaningless.

Fix — snapshot-and-restore pattern, experiment-level:

- NEW `mcp_server/experiment/baseline.py` — `BaselineTransportState`
  dataclass + `capture_baseline(ableton)` +
  `restore_baseline(ableton, baseline, stabilize_ms=300)`.
  Captures `is_playing`, `song_time`, and per-track
  `mute`/`solo`/`arm` via a single `get_session_info` round-trip.
  Restore issues `stop_playback` → per-track
  `set_track_mute`/`set_track_solo`/`set_track_arm` → 300 ms
  stabilize sleep. Per-track failures are logged, not fatal (a
  single flaky track never aborts restore for the rest).
- `ExperimentSet` gains a `baseline_transport: Optional[BaselineTransportState]`
  field. `to_dict()` surfaces it when populated.
- `engine.prepare_for_next_branch(ableton, baseline, stabilize_ms)`
  — thin wrapper called by `run_experiment` between branches.
  No-op when baseline is None (first branch).
- `run_experiment` captures the baseline once before the branch
  loop starts, stashes it on the experiment, and calls
  `prepare_for_next_branch` before every branch after the first.
  Capture failure logs + degrades to None (pre-v1.19 behavior).

**Stabilize window defaults to 300 ms** — midpoint of plan §2's
200-500 ms empirical range. Per-branch overhead stayed at
~1.04 s amortized under live 5-branch testing (well under the
plan's 2-second-per-branch success criterion target).

**Live evidence of state preservation:** 5-branch test with two
mutations on track 0 "Dub Chord" (pan -0.35 by `widen_stereo`,
then volume 0.4 by `darken_without_losing_width`) returned the
track to identical pre-experiment state (arm=true, mute=false,
solo=false) after every branch cycle.

Known limitations (accepted per plan §2):
- Automation drift is not frozen — deeper refactor out of scope.
- Send values + device parameters mutated outside a branch's own
  steps fall back to `undo()` alone — no explicit restore.
- Transport position is NOT re-seeked; `song_time` is captured
  but unused (stopping is enough).

21 unit tests added: capture (transport fields, empty tracks,
missing-field defaults, epoch-ms timestamp), restore (command
sequence, per-track mute/solo/arm restoration, stabilize sleep
with monkey-patched time.sleep, flaky-track resilience,
return-track arm skip), `ExperimentSet.baseline_transport`
(default None, to_dict surfacing/omission), engine helper
(None no-op, delegation), tool-level wiring (`run_experiment`
populates baseline once + idempotent on second run).

### Item B — Hybrid concept packet compilation

Pre-v1.19 the director handled "Basic Channel meets Dilla swing"
via LLM ad-hoc reasoning — no explicit rule for contradictions
(e.g., Gas deprioritizes rhythmic, Dilla emphasizes rhythmic;
what survives the hybrid?). v1.18.0 Test 7 verified plausible
output but entirely improvisational, with no guarantee either
source packet's `avoid` list or tempo constraints would persist.

Fix — explicit merge algorithm with canonical rules per plan §3:

- NEW `mcp_server/creative_director/hybrid.py` —
  `compile_hybrid_brief(packet_ids, weights=None)` loads concept
  packets from `livepilot/skills/livepilot-core/references/concepts/`
  and applies merge rules:
    * `sonic_identity` / `avoid` / `reach_for.*` / `*_idioms` /
      `sample_roles` / `dimensions_in_scope`: UNION, deduplicated,
      first-packet order preserved.
    * `dimensions_deprioritized` / `move_family_bias.deprioritize`:
      INTERSECTION — only deprioritize if ALL packets agree.
      Safer default: one packet's ignored dimension shouldn't
      starve another packet's wanted one.
    * `move_family_bias.favor`: INTERSECTION when non-empty
      (hybrid focuses where both agree), UNION fallback with
      warning when empty.
    * `evaluation_bias.target_dimensions`: WEIGHTED AVERAGE
      (default uniform; override via `weights`).
    * `evaluation_bias.protect`: MAX per dimension (stricter
      floor wins).
    * `novelty_budget_default`: MAX (hybrid asks skew
      exploratory).
    * `tempo_hint`: NEAREST-OVERLAP — intersect overlapping
      ranges, else midpoint + `disjoint: true` flag + warning.

- NEW MCP tool `compile_hybrid_brief` in
  `mcp_server/creative_director/tools.py` (tool count 428 → 429).
  Accepts packet IDs as filename stems (`"basic-channel"`),
  aliases (`"dilla"`), or packet `id` values
  (`"dub_techno__basic_channel"`). Returns ValueError as an
  error-dict response (doesn't raise).

- NEW reference doc
  `livepilot/skills/livepilot-creative-director/references/hybrid-compilation.md`
  — canonical merge-rule table, output shape, interop notes,
  guidance for handling the `warnings` list.

- Director SKILL.md Phase 1 — explicit guidance to call
  `compile_hybrid_brief` when the user names 2+ references,
  with a mandate to surface any `warnings` entries (don't
  silently average disjoint tempos).

- Output exposes merged `avoid` also as `anti_patterns` alias
  for drop-in compat with `check_brief_compliance` (v1.18.3).
  Live interop test: Basic Channel × J Dilla hybrid correctly
  flagged a Hi Gain boost via `check_brief_compliance`.

31 unit tests added: packet loading (stem / alias / id /
underscore-to-hyphen normalization / missing), input validation
(min 2 packets / missing packet / weights length mismatch),
UNION rules (avoid / sonic_identity / reach_for /
dimensions_in_scope), INTERSECTION rules (deprioritized
dimensions / `move_family_bias.deprioritize` /
`move_family_bias.favor` non-empty case / UNION fallback with
warning), WEIGHTED AVERAGE (default + custom weights), MAX rules
(protect / novelty_budget), tempo_hint (overlap intersection /
disjoint midpoint with warning), 3+ packet composition, output
metadata (`type` / `source_packets` / hybrid name /
`locked_dimensions=[]` / warnings list), and interoperability
(hybrid brief passed through `check_brief_compliance`).

### Live test coverage (13 scenarios)

Item B: BC × Dilla (disjoint tempos) · BC × Villalobos
(overlapping tempos, NO disjoint flag) · alias + spaced-name
resolution · invalid packet error · 3-packet hybrid
(BC + Dilla + Villalobos) · weighted average 75/25 · genre ×
artist (ambient × basinski, tempo=0 case) · full hybrid brief
→ `check_brief_compliance` interop (quantize_clip flagged).

Item A: 3-branch experiment (all snapshots populated, ranking
produced) · 5-branch experiment (1.04s/branch amortized
overhead) · state preservation under 2 mutations on track 0
(Dub Chord) across 5-branch cycle · `discard_experiment` cleanup.

### Known gaps deferred to v1.19.1

- `experiment.baseline_transport` populated internally but not
  surfaced through `compare_experiments` response. 3-line fix
  for operator visibility; not a correctness issue.
- `warnings` message rounds tempo midpoint to int display (128
  BPM) while range returned is exact (125-130, centered 127.5).
  Two rounding conventions. Cosmetic.
- `weights` in response show full float precision
  (`0.3333333333333333`) instead of rounding to 4 dp like
  `target_dimensions` already does. Cosmetic.

### Still open for v1.20 (Item C from the plan)

- Route director's Phase 6 execution through `apply_semantic_move`
  / `create_experiment + commit_experiment` so the action ledger
  populates automatically and anti-repetition becomes reliable.
  Doc-level fix shipped in v1.18.1; architectural fix deferred
  to v1.20 per plan §5 blast-radius rationale. Requires 5-10
  new semantic_moves to cover current Phase 6 patterns
  (return-chain builds, multi-param device presets, chord
  source loading, send routing, etc.).

Test suite: 2854 pass, 1 skipped (from 2792 pre-v1.19). Zero
regressions. sync_metadata --check clean.

## 1.18.3 — Brief compliance runtime check (#7 + #8) (April 24 2026)

Third v1.18.x patch. Bundles two Known Issues items (#7 + #8) that
shared the same "check tool args against brief constraints" machinery.

### Fix

- **#7 Packet `avoid` list runtime enforcement.**
- **#8 `locked_dimensions` runtime enforcement.**

Both were advisory-only pre-v1.18.3: the director SKILL.md documented
the hard-filter rules but no runtime machinery verified compliance.
This release ships a **stateless pure check function** in a new
`mcp_server/creative_director` module, exposed as the MCP tool
`check_brief_compliance(brief, tool_name, tool_args)`.

**Usage**: director's Phase 6 calls the tool before each risky
execution (EQ parameters, filter settings, new scene creation, clip
note editing, send routing, etc.). The tool returns
`{"ok": bool, "violations": [...]}`. Violations are reports, not
automatic blocks — the director surfaces them to the user and offers
three paths: adjust, override-for-this-turn, or pick a different tool.

**Detection strategy — best-effort heuristic**, not semantic
understanding:

- anti_pattern matching via keyword tokens + parameter-name heuristics
  (e.g., pattern "bright top-end" + Hi Gain positive value → fires)
- locked_dimension matching via tool → dimension map
  (e.g., structural lock + create_scene → fires)

### Infrastructure

- NEW module `mcp_server/creative_director/` with compliance.py +
  tools.py
- NEW MCP tool `check_brief_compliance` (tool count 427 → 428,
  domain count 52 → 53)
- Director SKILL.md Phase 6 now documents the check + the
  three-path violation-response protocol
- Full session-state active-brief storage is deferred to v1.19;
  v1.18.3 is stateless (caller passes brief each time)

### Tests added

- `test_compliance_check_detects_anti_pattern_violation` (BC packet
  + Hi Gain boost → violation)
- `test_compliance_check_detects_locked_dimension_violation`
  (structural lock + create_scene → violation)
- `test_compliance_check_passes_compliant_call` (no false positives)
- `test_compliance_check_empty_brief_permissive` (fresh session
  safety)

Test suite: 2792 pass, 1 skipped. Zero regressions.

### Still open for v1.19 (3 items)

- Experiment state continuity between branches (architectural —
  transport-state locking needed)
- Hybrid-packet compilation algorithm (union/intersection logic for
  multi-packet refs like "Basic Channel meets Dilla")
- Full architectural fix for #3 (route director Phase 6 through
  `apply_semantic_move` / `commit_experiment` — replaces the
  doc-level fix shipped in v1.18.1)

These are v1.19 scope — each needs new architectural decisions and
infrastructure unsuitable for patch releases.

## 1.18.2 — Wonder cold-start + tie-break + genre catalog closure (April 24 2026)

Second patch in the v1.18.x series. Three items from the v1.18.0/v1.18.1
Known Issues list resolved. Test suite grew to 2785 pass, xfail marker
removed (formerly 1, now 0).

### Fixes

- **#10 Wonder Mode zero-variant degradation on empty session context.**
  `enter_wonder_mode` on an empty/sparse session was returning 3
  IDENTICAL `analytical_only` variants all with intent "Analytical
  suggestion for: <request>". Live-verified during v1.18.0 Test 4
  ("I'm stuck" on a 4-track empty session). Fix: introduced
  `_COLD_START_SEEDS` in `mcp_server/wonder_mode/engine.py` — three
  distinct starting-point suggestions covering different families
  (`device_creation × rhythmic` + `sound_design × harmonic` +
  `mix × architecture-first`). When `executable_count == 0`, the
  padding loop uses `build_cold_start_variant()` which pulls from
  the seed set by index, producing genuinely distinct variants with
  specific actionable `what_changed` / `why_it_matters` text.
  Partial-match case (1-2 executable) still uses the generic
  fallback to avoid mixing real moves with architecture-first seeds.

- **#11 Experiment ranking tie-break coarseness.**
  `ExperimentSet.ranked_branches()` was a single-key sort by score,
  producing unstable rankings at score ties. Live-verified in v1.18.0
  Test 8 — 3-branch experiment with `add_space` + `add_warmth` +
  `widen_stereo` all scored 0.6 with no clear winner. Fix: composite
  sort key via new `_branch_rank_key()` helper, in priority order:
  (1) `-score` (primary, higher wins), (2) `-novelty_rank` (higher
  novelty wins score ties — creative asks reward variation),
  (3) `risk_rank` (lower risk wins secondary ties — safety default),
  (4) `step_count` (simpler plans win tertiary ties),
  (5) `branch_id` (deterministic final tiebreak for reproducibility).

- **Concept packet catalog closure.** 13 new genre YAMLs
  (drone, downtempo, lo_fi, boom_bap, footwork, techno,
  detroit_techno, synthwave, deep_house, disco, soul, dub, hyperpop)
  + 15 too-generic/narrow refs removed from 12 artist packets
  (electronic ×5, electronica, bass_music, cinematic, acid_techno,
  french_house, nu_disco, soulful_house, vaporwave, juke, jungle).
  The xfailing `test_all_artist_genre_refs_resolve_strictly` test
  is now a required green pass. The concept surface has full graph
  closure — every artist→genre cross-reference resolves to an actual
  genre YAML's `id` field.

### Tests added / changed

- `test_wonder_cold_start_has_distinct_variants` (new — guards
  against regression to the 3-identical-generics degradation)
- `test_experiment_tie_break_prefers_higher_novelty` (new — unexpected
  > strong > safe at equal scores)
- `test_experiment_tie_break_is_deterministic` (new — ranking stable
  across input order)
- `test_all_artist_genre_refs_resolve_strictly` (was xfailing, now
  passing — xfail marker removed)
- `test_concept_packets_count` (floor updated 14 → 27 genres)

### Still open for v1.18.3 / v1.19

5 items remain from the original v1.18.0 Known Issues list:

- **#7 Packet `avoid` list runtime enforcement** (still advisory —
  pre-flight check against tool args needed)
- **#8 `locked_dimensions` runtime enforcement** (same pattern as #7)
- **Experiment state continuity between branches** (before-snapshot
  drift)
- **Hybrid-packet compilation algorithm** (union/intersection logic
  for "Basic Channel meets Dilla")
- **Full architectural fix for #3** (route director Phase 6 through
  semantic_move commits — big redesign, v1.19 scope)

These all need new infrastructure or architectural decisions
unsuitable for a patch release.

## 1.18.1 — Director HIGH-severity patches (April 23 2026)

Patch release addressing 4 of the 12 known issues documented in v1.18.0.
All three HIGH-severity bugs are fixed, plus 6 medium-severity items
(data cleanups and doc clarifications). All fixes landed with
regression-guard tests. 2779 project tests pass + 1 xfail (pre-existing).

### High-severity fixes

- **#1 `create_experiment` auto-proposal returned single-char move_ids.**
  Python unpacking bug at `mcp_server/experiment/tools.py:267` —
  `[m[0] for m, _ in scored]` indexed the first character of each
  move_id string. Fix: `[move_id for move_id, _ in scored[:limit]]`.
  Pre-fix, calling the director's Flow B with no explicit seeds/move_ids
  would always fail at run_experiment with `"Move t not found"`.

- **#2 `propose_composer_branches` ignored concept-packet arrangement
  idioms.** Dub-techno prompts (referencing Basic Channel, Gas, etc.)
  were collapsed to the generic techno template (Intro→Build→Drop→
  Breakdown→Drop 2→Outro with 6 standard layers). Fix: "dub techno"
  is now its own canonical genre in `GENRE_DEFAULTS` and
  `SECTION_TEMPLATES`, with a continuous-evolution scaffold
  (Dawn→Pulse→Chord→Depth→Withdraw→Return, 3-5 layers, energy 0.4).
  Removed the `dub techno → techno` alias that was causing the
  collapse; added `dub-techno` (hyphenated) as an alias to the new
  canonical.

- **#3 Director raw-tool-call path bypassed the action ledger.**
  Min-effective doc fix: Phase 6 of `livepilot-creative-director`
  now mandates `add_session_memory(category="move_executed", ...)`
  after raw-tool execution batches, so anti-repetition detection on
  subsequent creative turns isn't blind. Added a state-inference
  fallback table in `anti-repetition-rules.md` for when the ledger
  is still empty (infer recent family from loaded devices, non-default
  mixer state, clip slot contents). Full architectural fix (route all
  Phase 6 execution through `apply_semantic_move`/`commit_experiment`)
  is deferred to v1.19.

### Medium-severity fixes

- **#4 Ping Pong Delay ghost packet.** `affordances/devices/ping-pong-delay.yaml`
  previously described a standalone device that doesn't exist in
  Live 12 (`search_browser` returned empty). Rewritten as an explicit
  mode-alias for Echo with `Channel Mode = 1`. `echo.yaml` now prominently
  documents the Channel Mode enum (0=Stereo, 1=Ping Pong, 2=Mid/Side).

- **#5 Auto Filter affordance used legacy 20-135 Hz ranges.** Modern
  `AutoFilter2` class (Live 12 default) uses 0-1 normalized for
  Frequency, Resonance, and LFO Amount. Live-verified mapping (raw
  0.45 → display 448 Hz) is now documented in the YAML. Legacy/modern
  distinction clarified in the notes.

- **#9 `propose_composer_branches` silent count degradation.** Explicit
  `count=3` at `freshness<0.7` was silently returning 2 seeds because
  `layer_contrast` was gated behind `freshness>=0.7`. Fix: explicit
  `count>=3` now raises freshness internally to 0.7 to admit all
  strategies. Default `count=2` (no override) still respects the
  freshness gate — preserves the "freshness shapes default strategy
  count" contract and the existing tests that assert it.

- **#12 Low-novelty-budget escape hatch for 3-plan diversity rule.**
  `move-family-diversity-rule.md` gained a dedicated section: when
  `novelty_budget < 0.35` (user prompts like "keep the vibe, just
  cleaner"), 1-2 family plans is acceptable and honest. Prevents the
  rule from fighting cleanup requests.

### Bonus fixes

- **`batch_set_parameters` schema gotcha documented.** Core SKILL.md
  Rule 15 now shows the correct dict-of-dicts shape:
  `{"ParamName": {"value": v}}`. Live verification surfaced this during
  v1.18.0 pressure testing.

- **Convolution Reverb phantom `ir_length` already fixed in v1.18.0
  commit 9** — regression test now guards against reintroduction.

### Tests added

- `test_create_experiment_auto_proposal_no_m0_bug` (source-pattern
  regression guard)
- `test_create_experiment_auto_proposal_functional` (mirror-logic
  integration check)
- `test_composer_dub_techno_prompt_avoids_drop_scaffold` (no Drop/Drop 2
  on Basic Channel prompts)
- `test_propose_composer_branches_honors_explicit_count` (count=3
  returns 3 regardless of freshness)
- `test_medium_freshness_count_3_unlocks_all_strategies` (renamed from
  test encoding the pre-fix bug as desired behavior)
- `test_medium_freshness_default_count_gives_two` (preserves
  default-count-respects-freshness contract)
- `test_ping_pong_delay_is_documented_as_echo_mode`
- `test_auto_filter_ranges_are_normalized_for_modern_class`
- `test_low_novelty_escape_hatch_documented`
- `test_batch_set_parameters_schema_documented`
- `test_director_phase6_records_ledger_marker`
- `test_anti_repetition_has_state_inference_fallback`

### Still open for v1.18.2 / v1.19

8 items remain from the v1.18.0 Known Issues list:

- **#7 Packet `avoid` list runtime enforcement** (currently advisory —
  pre-flight check against tool args needed)
- **#8 `locked_dimensions` runtime enforcement** (same pattern as #7)
- **#10 Wonder Mode zero-variant degradation on empty session context**
- **#11 Evaluation tie-break coarseness** (3-way ties at score 0.6)
- **Experiment state continuity between branches** (before-snapshot
  drift)
- **Hybrid-packet compilation algorithm** (union/intersection logic
  for "Basic Channel meets Dilla")
- **~20 missing genre YAMLs** (downtempo, boom_bap, lo_fi, synthwave,
  techno, etc.) — xfail test tracks this
- **Full architectural fix for #3** (route director Phase 6 through
  semantic_move commits, replacing the doc-level fix shipped here)

These are each scoped for focused follow-up sessions — they need new
infrastructure or architectural decisions not suitable for a patch
release.

## 1.18.0 — Creative Director + concept packets + device affordances (April 23 2026)

A structural feature release. Addresses the "agent doesn't variate
enough, feels stuck in the same repetitive patterns" failure mode by
adding an enforcement layer on top of the existing tool surface.
**Zero new Python. Zero new MCP tools.** The entire feature is skill
documentation, structured YAML data, and prompt-level contracts.

### Added

- **`livepilot-creative-director` skill** — new top-level skill that
  routes creative intent through mandatory divergence before any
  commit. Eight-phase contract: ground → compile brief → generate 3
  plans with distinct `move.family` → cover 4 dimensions → preview
  or rank → select + execute → evaluate → record. Critics (analyze_mix,
  evaluate_move) DEFER until Phase 7 — firing them earlier pre-converges
  the answer. Includes four reference files:
  - `creative-brief-template.md` — YAML schema + 4 filled examples,
    novelty_budget table with 6 user-framing buckets
  - `move-family-diversity-rule.md` — canonical 6 families + family-vs-
    dimension split + collision-avoidance rules
  - `anti-repetition-rules.md` — recency threshold table (0-2/10
    neutral, 3-4/10 least-weighted, ≥5/10 EXCLUDED) + borderline-
    stuckness band (0.4-0.5 surfaces user option)
  - `the-four-move-rule.md` — structural + rhythmic + timbral + spatial
    dimension coverage with narrow-idiom exceptions for dub-techno /
    ambient / beat-focused packets

- **Structured concept packets** (42 YAMLs under
  `livepilot/skills/livepilot-core/references/concepts/`) — 28 artist
  packets + 14 genre packets. Each packet carries `sonic_identity`,
  `reach_for`, `avoid` (HARD filter), `evaluation_bias.target_dimensions`
  + `protect` floors, `move_family_bias.favor` + `deprioritize`,
  `dimensions_in_scope` + `dimensions_deprioritized`, and
  `novelty_budget_default`. Narrative `artist-vocabularies.md` and
  `genre-vocabularies.md` stay as human-facing overviews; YAMLs are
  the machine source-of-truth.

- **Device affordance metadata** (20 YAMLs under
  `livepilot/skills/livepilot-core/references/affordances/`) — per-
  device affordance packets for Echo, Auto Filter, Convolution Reverb,
  Hybrid Reverb, Ping Pong Delay, Drift, Corpus, Granulator III,
  Simpler, Wavetable, Operator, Poli, Saturator, Compressor, Glue
  Compressor, Utility, EQ Eight, Chorus-Ensemble, Shifter, Vinyl
  Distortion. Each covers `musical_roles`, `strong_for` / `risky_for`,
  `subtle` / `moderate` / `aggressive` parameter ranges, `pairings`
  (with before/after/parallel order), `anti_pairings`, `remeasure`
  queue, and `dimensional_impact` mapping to the four-move-rule.

- **Evaluation artistic dimensions** — `livepilot-evaluation/SKILL.md`
  extended with Family B dimensions (style_fit, distinctiveness,
  motif_coherence, section_contrast, restraint, surprise_without_breakage)
  in addition to Family A (punch, weight, etc). Both required for
  creative-director turns.

- **Creative-success verdict taxonomy** — 5 verdicts assigned at
  evaluation Step 8b: `safe_win`, `bold_win`, `interesting_failure`,
  `identity_break`, `generic_fallback`. Drives promotion decisions.

- **Verdict-gated reflection promotion rubric** — `memory-guide.md`
  extended with a promotion matrix that keeps memory from converging
  on safe_win-adjacent moves. `bold_win` promotes immediately;
  `safe_win` conditional on user-keep-for-2-turns; `interesting_failure`
  curiosity-store only; `identity_break` and `generic_fallback` record
  anti-preferences instead.

- **Schema test harness** — `tests/test_creative_director.py` (27
  passing, 1 xfail tracking missing genre YAMLs). Verifies skill file
  structure, packet counts, canonical family/dimension enforcement,
  cross-reference resolution, and cross-skill integration (director ↔
  evaluation ↔ memory-guide).

### Changed

- `livepilot-core/SKILL.md`: fixed semantic_moves family count (5→6,
  `device_creation` was missing from the docs). Added director routing
  pointer in the V2 Engine Skills table and Flow B preamble.
- `livepilot-wonder/SKILL.md`: added creative-director as a trigger
  (not only stuck-rescue); split honesty rule to actively widen across
  families BEFORE accepting <3 variants on first-pass creative calls.
- `livepilot-producer/AGENT.md`: director added to subagent skills
  index with "load FIRST on open-ended creative intent" note.
- `artist-vocabularies.md` + `genre-vocabularies.md`: cross-reference
  callouts pointing to the new YAML packets.
- `m4l_device/LivePilot_Analyzer.amxd` + `.maxpat` + `livepilot_bridge.js`:
  versioning text added to analyzer UI for live identification across
  instances.

### Pressure-testing

The director was developed under TDD-for-skills discipline: three
subagent pressure-scenarios run in two rounds, with verdict-driven
fixes between rounds. Round 1 surfaced 9 issues, Round 2 verified
each was fixed and surfaced 3 more (higher-order patterns only visible
after first-order bugs were gone). PR 3 affordance work caught 3
schema-level bugs (`atlas_uri` semantic mismatch, phantom
`ir_length`, parameter-name canonicalization gap) before ship.

### Known gaps

- ~20 narrative-only genres (downtempo, boom_bap, lo_fi, synthwave,
  techno, detroit_techno, soul, footwork, deep_house, french_house,
  disco, electronic, electronica, cinematic, hyperpop, drone,
  bass_music, soulful_house, acid_techno, nu_disco, juke) referenced
  by artist packets but not yet YAML-ified. Tracked via
  `test_all_artist_genre_refs_resolve_strictly` xfail.

### Known issues from pre-ship live verification (v1.18.1 patch targets)

12 issues surfaced while running director end-to-end against a real
Ableton session before pushing v1.18.0. Shipping as-is rather than
blocking the release; patching in a focused follow-up. Severity is
this author's subjective production-impact rating.

**High severity — users will hit these in the first 30 seconds:**

1. **`create_experiment` auto-proposal is broken.** When called without
   explicit `seeds` or `move_ids`, the keyword-overlap selector
   generates single-character `move_id` values (`"t"`, `"w"`, `"m"`)
   that fail with `"Move t not found"` at run time. All three branches
   fail. Workaround: director MUST pass explicit `move_ids=[...]` —
   auto-proposal path is unusable. (`mcp_server/experiment/engine.py`
   auto-propose logic.)
2. **`propose_composer_branches` ignores concept packets.** A prompt
   referencing Basic Channel produced generic EDM scaffold
   (`Intro → Build → Drop → Breakdown → Drop 2 → Outro` + 6 standard
   layers) instead of BC's continuous-evolution dub-techno form.
   Composer falls back to genre-family defaults and doesn't consult
   `concepts/artists/*.yaml` or `concepts/genres/*.yaml` arrangement_idioms.
3. **Director Plan A bypasses the action ledger.** When the director
   executes via raw tool calls (`load_browser_item`, `set_device_parameter`,
   etc.) instead of `apply_semantic_move` / `create_experiment +
   commit_experiment`, `get_last_move` returns empty and anti-repetition
   goes blind. Either make semantic_move commits mandatory for director
   plan execution, or add a session-state inference fallback that reads
   device/track deltas directly.

**Medium severity — edges and enforcement gaps:**

4. **Affordance YAML — Ping Pong Delay is a ghost packet.**
   `affordances/devices/ping-pong-delay.yaml` describes a standalone
   device that doesn't exist in Live 12 (empty `search_browser` result).
   Ping-pong is a MODE of `Echo` (`Channel Mode = 1`). Merge the
   affordance into `echo.yaml` or delete the file.
5. **Affordance YAML — Auto Filter ranges are legacy.** Modern
   `AutoFilter2` class uses 0-1 normalized for Frequency (display
   `"448 Hz"` at raw `0.45`), NOT the 20-135 legacy range the affordance
   YAML documents. Either update the affordance to reflect
   AutoFilter2 OR ship separate legacy/modern variants.
6. **Affordance YAML — `ir_length` phantom on Convolution Reverb.**
   Already fixed in commit 9 by renaming to `decay_time`, but worth
   flagging that this class of field-vs-actual drift needs a
   systematic check (script that compares affordance parameter names
   to `get_device_parameters` output for each device).
7. **Packet `avoid` list is advisory, not runtime-enforced.** Director
   SKILL.md documents the hard-filter rule but there's no code path
   that compares user requests or tool args against the active packet's
   `avoid` list before executing. Ask for "bump the high-end" under an
   active BC packet and nothing blocks the EQ boost.
8. **`locked_dimensions` respect is declarative only.** Same class as
   (7) — director compiles a brief with explicit locks but no runtime
   pre-flight check blocks tool calls that touch locked dimensions.
9. **`propose_composer_branches` silent `count` degradation.** Requesting
   3 branches at `freshness < 0.7` returns 2 (only canonical +
   energy_shift). User-visible surface returns fewer than requested
   without flagging.
10. **Wonder Mode degrades to zero executable variants on empty/sparse
    session context.** Tested with `enter_wonder_mode("I'm stuck")` on
    a mostly-empty session — returned 3 identical analytical-only
    variants with `"No matching executable moves found"`. Needs a
    cold-start path that proposes starting-point seeds from memory
    or concept packets rather than requiring existing session content.
11. **Evaluation tie-break is coarse.** 3-branch experiment with
    different semantic moves (add_space, add_warmth, widen_stereo)
    all scored identical 0.6. No clear winner emerges. Classifier
    needs finer resolution OR explicit tie-break by novelty/taste.
12. **Low-novelty-budget escape hatch missing from 3-plan rule.**
    `"keep the vibe, just cleaner"` → `novelty_budget = 0.30`. The
    3-distinct-families rule fights against narrow cleanup requests.
    Need explicit clause: "if `novelty_budget < 0.35`, 1-2 mix-family
    plans is acceptable and honest."

**Also worth fixing:**

- `batch_set_parameters` schema — requires `{"Name": {"value": v}}`,
  not `{"Name": v}`. Docs didn't make this obvious.
- State continuity between experiment branches — before-snapshot
  track levels drifted between branches (0.76 → 0 → 0.87). Each
  branch sees a different baseline. Needs transport-state locking.
- Hybrid-reference compilation algorithm — multi-packet asks
  ("Basic Channel meets Dilla swing") work via LLM ad-hoc reasoning,
  not via explicit union/intersection logic. Define the rule.

All 15 items are tracked for a v1.18.1 patch. The core v1.18.0
machinery (8-phase director contract, concept packets, affordances,
evaluation dimensions, verdict taxonomy) works correctly when plans
are constructed with explicit `move_ids` — which is the documented
primary path.

### Live Ableton session result

Test scenario: build a Basic Channel dub chain on a return track, then
source (Meld Juno Square chord stab) with sends. Chain built cleanly.
User feedback on initial Plan A: "super basic" (default presets lack
character). Swapped Drift default → `Poly Juno Square.adv` preset.
Improved character. Flow A of the director (build a single plan, verify,
iterate) is production-viable today. Flow B (divergence via experiment)
has the 3 high-severity issues above.

### Process note

This release was authored in a single session as a series of 6 PRs
(Creative Director skill → Concept packets → Affordances → Evaluation
dimensions → Reflection rubric → Test harness), each pressure-tested
before moving to the next. Outside-reviewer design plan is at
`docs/plans/livepilot_creativity_plan.md`.

## 1.17.5 — Classify error-only commit payloads as failures (April 23 2026)

### Fixed

- **`_classify_commit_result` now catches error-only commit payloads**
  (`mcp_server/tools/_agent_os_engine/iteration.py`): Codex review on
  PR #27 caught a gap I shipped in v1.17.3. My docstring listed
  `{"error": ...}` as a known failure signal, but the implementation
  never checked for a top-level `error` key. `commit_branch_async` in
  `mcp_server/experiment/engine.py` returns error-only dicts in 5+
  paths (`Branch {id} not found`, `Branch has no compiled plan`,
  `Experiment {id} not found`). These fell through to
  `"committed"` because they had no explicit `committed: false` /
  `ok: false` / `status: "failed"` / `steps_ok: 0` signal. Classic
  truth-gap: the iteration loop could claim success while the commit
  applied zero steps.

  Fix: if `result.get("error")` is truthy AND `result.get("committed")`
  is not explicitly `True`, return `"commit_failed"`. The explicit-
  committed caveat handles the edge case where a payload reports
  success with a warning in the `error` field.

### Tests

4 new TDD tests in `tests/test_iterate_toward_goal.py`:
- `{"error": "Experiment not found"}` → `commit_failed`
- `{"error": "Branch not found"}` (real commit_branch_async shape) →
  `commit_failed`, with the payload surfaced on `commit_result`
- Same discipline on the `on_timeout="commit_best"` path
- Edge case: `{"committed": True, "error": "warning...",
  steps_ok: 3}` still returns `committed` (explicit success overrides)

2726 → 2730 passing.

### Process note

The fix that shipped in v1.17.3 was itself caught by a subsequent
review. Writing a docstring listing a failure signal and forgetting
to implement the check is the classic TDD violation the discipline
exists to prevent. Codex's automated review acted as the missing
failing-test-first pass.

## 1.17.4 — Shape cleanup + memory probe (April 23 2026)

### Fixed

- **`get_session_kernel` now probes the memory store** instead of
  hardcoding `memory_ok=True` (`mcp_server/runtime/tools.py`). If the
  underlying technique store raises on `list_techniques` (disk full,
  corrupted index, permissions error), the kernel previously still
  reported memory as available to orchestration planners. Same
  truth-gap class as the v1.17.3 web/flucoma fix — should have been
  caught by the same review pass. Now probed the same way
  `get_capability_state` does, wrapped in try/except.
- **`capability_state` flat shape** in session kernel
  (`mcp_server/runtime/tools.py`): `state.to_dict()` wraps its output as
  `{"capability_state": {...}}` — that's the right shape for the
  standalone `get_capability_state` tool, but when stored on the kernel
  it produced the ugly double-nested
  `kernel["capability_state"]["capability_state"]["domains"]`. v1.17.3
  probe tests worked around it with defensive
  `outer.get("capability_state", outer)`. Fix: unwrap the outer key
  once before passing to `build_session_kernel`. Consumer path is
  now `kernel["capability_state"]["domains"]` directly. Standalone
  `get_capability_state` return shape unchanged.

### Tests

- 4 new TDD tests in `tests/test_runtime_capability_probes.py`:
  - memory probe raises → kernel reports memory unavailable
  - memory probe succeeds → kernel reports available
  - kernel's capability_state has no nested `capability_state` key
  - end-to-end flat access without defensive fallbacks
- Consumer updates:
  - `test_session_kernel.py:203` — removed extra level
  - `test_runtime_capability_probes.py` (4 places) — removed
    defensive `outer.get('capability_state', outer)` pattern now that
    the shape is known-flat

2722 → 2726 passing.

### Known follow-up

Audit while writing this release flagged a third bug in
`mcp_server/runtime/safety_kernel.py:244`: the safety kernel reads
`capability_state.get("mode", "normal")` but the actual shape uses
`overall_mode`, not `mode`. The `.get(..., "normal")` default silently
falls back, so `read_only` mode gating never kicks in. Separate fix,
out of scope for this release.

## 1.17.3 — Truth-gap remediation, for real (April 23 2026)

### Fixed

- **`iterate_toward_goal` now inspects `commit_fn` return value** (P1,
  `mcp_server/tools/_agent_os_engine/iteration.py`): prior to this release
  the iteration loop awaited the commit callback and dropped the return
  value on the floor, then unconditionally returned `status="committed"`.
  If the underlying `commit_branch_async` applied zero steps or partially
  succeeded, the iteration result claimed success — the exact bug pattern
  the release was meant to fix elsewhere. New `_classify_commit_result()`
  helper maps known payload shapes to three statuses: `"committed"` (clean),
  `"committed_with_errors"` (steps_ok > 0 AND steps_failed > 0), and
  `"commit_failed"` (committed=False, ok=False, status="failed", or
  steps_ok == 0). Both sync and async cores now zero out
  `committed_experiment_id`/`committed_branch_id` when the commit truly
  failed, and surface the raw commit payload on `IterationResult.commit_result`.
- **Preview Studio commit-before-execute ordering** (P1,
  `mcp_server/preview_studio/tools.py`): `commit_preview_variant()` called
  `engine.commit_variant()` BEFORE `execute_plan_steps_async` ran. That
  flipped `preview_set.status = "committed"` and `committed_variant_id`
  up front, so when every execution step failed the response correctly
  said `committed: false / status: "failed"` but the stored state still
  said the opposite. Wonder lifecycle advance also fired regardless.
  Reorder: execute first, then flip state only when `steps_ok > 0`.
  Zero-success path now returns honestly and leaves `preview_set` and
  WonderSession untouched. Partial-success stays a legitimate commit
  with `status="committed_with_errors"`.
- **`get_session_kernel` propagates web + flucoma probe results** (P2,
  `mcp_server/runtime/tools.py`): the kernel builder called
  `build_capability_state(...)` with only session/analyzer/memory params,
  so `web_ok` and `flucoma_ok` silently defaulted to `False`. Meanwhile
  `get_capability_state()` correctly probed both. Planners that read
  the kernel (the documented orchestration entrypoint) stayed on
  degraded paths even when probes would have reported available. Fix:
  call `_probe_web()` + `_probe_flucoma()` inside `get_session_kernel`
  and pass through.

### Added

- **10 new tests** covering the three truth-gap classes:
  - `test_iterate_toward_goal.py`: 4 tests for commit inspection
    (failed commit, partial commit, timeout commit_best, back-compat
    clean success).
  - `test_preview_studio_truth_gap.py`: 3 tests for
    executable-variant-fails paths (all-steps-fail preserves state,
    Wonder not advanced, partial-success honest commit).
  - `test_runtime_capability_probes.py`: 3 tests for kernel
    propagation (web probe → kernel, flucoma probe → kernel,
    both-unavailable back-compat).
- **`IterationResult.commit_result`** — the raw commit_fn payload,
  surfaced on the returned dict whenever a commit was attempted.
  Callers can inspect `result["commit_result"]["steps_failed"]`,
  `result["commit_result"]["error"]`, etc.

This release closes what the post-v1.17.2 review correctly flagged:
the feature we shipped to "close the evaluation loop" had a truth-gap
at the innermost step. 2712 → 2722 tests pass.

## 1.17.2 — iterate_toward_goal + preview-studio truth-gap (April 23 2026)

### Added

- **`iterate_toward_goal` MCP tool** (`mcp_server/tools/agent_os.py`,
  `mcp_server/tools/_agent_os_engine/iteration.py`): closes the outer
  evaluation loop. Given a compiled `GoalVector` and a list of candidate
  move sets, runs up to N experiments sequentially. Each iteration
  creates an experiment, runs all branches (with per-branch
  apply-snapshot-undo already handled by the existing experiment engine),
  scores the top branch against the goal, and either commits (score ≥
  threshold) or discards and tries the next candidate set. On timeout,
  commits the best-so-far (`on_timeout="commit_best"`, default) or
  commits nothing (`on_timeout="discard_on_timeout"`). Per-branch undo
  stays inside `run_experiment` — this loop never issues a raw undo.
  Tool count: 426 → 427.

  Engine ships as both a pure-sync `iterate_toward_goal_engine` (for
  tests with in-memory fakes) and `iterate_toward_goal_engine_async`
  (for the live MCP wrapper with coroutine callbacks); the sync entry
  auto-detects coroutine callbacks and dispatches accordingly. Covered
  by 11 tests in `tests/test_iterate_toward_goal.py` spanning happy
  path, exhaustion + commit-best, exhaustion + discard, no candidates,
  no-winner iterations, max_iterations capping, async coroutine
  callbacks, and MCP registration.

  This is the P0 item from the v1.17.1 review gap-analysis between
  "tool orchestration" and "agentic optimization" — the create /
  run / compare / commit primitives existed but nothing drove them
  toward a scalar goal. `iterate_toward_goal` is that driver.

### Fixed

- **Preview Studio truth-gap** (`mcp_server/preview_studio/engine.py`,
  `mcp_server/preview_studio/tools.py`): two compounding bugs made the
  system lie about committed state.
  1. `compare_variants()` scored every variant without filtering for
     `status="blocked"` or missing `compiled_plan`. A blocked /
     analytical-only variant could win the recommendation even with a
     higher taste_fit than the only executable option. Fix: partition
     variants into executable vs analytical, score only the executable
     list, surface the analytical bucket on a new `analytical_candidates`
     field for introspection. `recommended` stays a bare string (or
     `None` when no executable variant exists) so no API shape breaks.
  2. `commit_preview_variant()` called `engine.commit_variant()` — which
     flips `preview_set.status = "committed"` and discards every sibling
     variant — BEFORE checking whether the chosen variant had a compiled
     plan. Analytical-only picks therefore got recorded as committed
     with `committed=False` in the response and the preview set's
     in-memory state said the opposite. Wonder lifecycle also advanced
     to `resolved`. Fix: short-circuit analytical/blocked picks at the
     top of the handler, return `{committed: False, reason:
     "analytical_only" | "blocked", ...}`, leave `preview_set.status`
     untouched, and gate Wonder lifecycle hooks behind the executable
     branch. New regressions in `tests/test_preview_studio_truth_gap.py`
     lock all four scenarios (A1-A4 from the remediation plan).
- **Runtime capability probes stop lying about `web` and `flucoma`**
  (`mcp_server/runtime/tools.py`, `mcp_server/runtime/capability_state.py`):
  `get_capability_state` previously hardcoded `web_ok=False` and never
  emitted a `flucoma` domain at all, causing `route_request` to pick
  degraded research/perception paths on machines where those
  capabilities were actually available. `_probe_web()` now runs a
  500 ms HEAD request to `https://api.github.com` using stdlib
  `urllib.request` (no new dependency); `_probe_flucoma()` uses
  `importlib.util.find_spec("flucoma")` with safe exception swallowing.
  The `flucoma` domain is now emitted unconditionally so consumers can
  distinguish "probed and missing" from "not probed yet".
- **`build_song_brain` flags degraded responses**
  (`mcp_server/song_brain/tools.py`): When `get_session_info` fails,
  the tool injected `{tempo: 120.0, track_count: 0}` and returned a
  polished SongBrain with no indication the inputs were synthesized.
  The fallback is preserved for backward compatibility but the
  response now carries a top-level `degradation` payload
  (`{is_degraded, reasons, substituted_fields}`) so callers can branch
  on synthesized vs real data.
- **`create_preview_set` flags the empty-kernel fallback**
  (`mcp_server/preview_studio/engine.py`,
  `mcp_server/preview_studio/models.py`): When the caller omits a real
  session kernel, `create_preview_set` synthesizes an empty-but-valid
  shape so compilers degrade to no-op steps. `PreviewSet` now carries a
  `degradation` field that is marked
  `is_degraded=True, reasons=["empty_kernel_fallback"]` whenever that
  substitution fires, so downstream consumers can tell a synthesized
  compile from a kernel-backed one.

### Added

- **`DegradationInfo` dataclass** (`mcp_server/runtime/degradation.py`):
  New shared payload that engines attach to their responses whenever
  they substitute fallback data. Three fields:
  `is_degraded: bool`, `reasons: list[str]`, `substituted_fields: list[str]`.
  Intentionally minimal and import-safe so any engine can adopt it
  without circular-import risk. Wired into `song_brain` and
  `preview_studio`; other engines will adopt it as audits surface more
  silent-fallback paths.
- **`flucoma` capability domain** now emitted by
  `build_capability_state` alongside `session_access`, `analyzer`,
  `memory`, `web`, and `research`. Matches the existing
  `CapabilityDomain` schema.

### Changed

- **`capability-modes.md` reference doc rewritten to match the actual
  response shape** (`livepilot/skills/livepilot-evaluation/references/capability-modes.md`).
  The old example JSON described a flat
  `{mode, analyzer_connected, bridge_version, spectral_cache_age_ms, flucoma_available, session_connected}`
  shape that hasn't matched `get_capability_state` for releases. The
  new section documents the nested `capability_state.domains.<name>`
  structure, explicit per-domain and per-field definitions, and
  explicitly scopes the `web` domain as *"server-side outbound HTTP
  capability; does NOT imply curated research corpora are installed"*.

### Tests

- `tests/test_preview_studio_truth_gap.py` — 5 tests locking the four
  A1-A4 scenarios from the remediation plan.
- `tests/test_runtime_capability_probes.py` — 6 tests covering the
  web probe (true/false/exception-swallow) and the flucoma probe
  (emitted-when-importable, emitted-when-missing, find_spec-backed).
- `tests/test_degradation_signalling.py` — 8 tests covering the
  `DegradationInfo` dataclass defaults, `song_brain` degradation on
  session failure, and `preview_studio` degradation on empty-kernel
  fallback.

## 1.17.1 — Splice auto-reconnect + Codex installer fix (April 23 2026)

Two bug fixes discovered in a parallel worktree hours after v1.17.0
shipped. Non-breaking, test-locked, ships as a patch.

### Fixed

- **Splice client auto-reconnect** (`mcp_server/sample_engine/tools.py`):
  Every Splice MCP tool now reconnects the shared gRPC client on demand
  via a new `_ensure_splice_client_connected()` helper. Before this fix,
  if the Splice desktop app launched AFTER the MCP server (common when
  users start the MCP via Claude Code before booting Splice), every
  Splice tool stayed stuck in a disconnected state until the WHOLE MCP
  server was restarted. The fix re-checks on every tool invocation, so
  the first successful Splice-desktop boot auto-recovers the client
  transparently. Tools affected: `get_splice_credits`,
  `splice_catalog_hunt`, `search_samples` (when routing through Splice),
  plus every other Splice tool that reads from the shared context.
  3 new regression tests in `tests/test_splice_reconnect_tools.py` lock
  the reconnect behavior.
- **Codex plugin installer writes `.mcp.json`** (`installer/codex.js`):
  The installer was copying plugin files into the Codex plugins
  directory but omitting the `.mcp.json` config that tells Codex how
  to launch the MCP server. Codex users had to manually create the
  file or run the command with additional flags. Now
  `writeLocalMcpConfig(destDir)` writes the correct
  `{mcpServers: {livepilot: {command, args}}}` shape during install.
  1 new regression test in `tests/test_codex_plugin_installer.py`
  asserts the file content.

### Verified

155/155 tests green. `sync_metadata.py --check`: all metadata in sync
at version=1.17.1, tools=426, domains=52, bridge_cmds=30, enriched=120.

### Distribution

Same channels as v1.17.0 — GitHub release + npm + `.mcpb` + plugin
cache. Tool count and domain count unchanged; this is purely a
reliability patch.


## 1.17.0 — 2026-04-22 handoff close-out (April 22 2026, late)

Closes every item in the 2026-04-22 handoff document: Splice's
Describe-a-Sound + Variations go LIVE via captured GraphQL
endpoints, the M4L Analyzer gains a 9th spectrum band (sub_low
20-60 Hz), track-level arrangement automation lands via a
two-phase session-record workaround, the atlas gains a
by_pack index + `atlas_pack_info` MCP tool, the device atlas
adds 13 enrichments including a Drum Rack container entry, and
Tier C of the pack-knowledge reference expands from 7 clusters
to 14 individually-documented packs.

**Tool count**: 422 → 426 (+5 new, −1 retired):
- `+` `atlas_pack_info` — inspect a pack's device list + enrichment coverage
- `+` `atlas_describe_chain` — free-text describe-a-chain, mirror of
  `splice_describe_sound` for the device library. "A granular pad like
  Tim Hecker" → device chain proposal via artist + genre vocabulary
  matching
- `+` `atlas_techniques_for_device` — reverse-lookup: what techniques
  reference this device? Reads an auto-generated index of 146 technique
  cross-references across 58 devices
- `+` `set_arrangement_automation_via_session_record` — T5 workaround,
  two-phase protocol with tempo-scaled sleep
- `+` `splice_http_diagnose` — per-endpoint verified-status reporter
- `−` `splice_search_with_sound` — retired (user handles
  audio-reference search directly in Splice's UI; capture recipe
  preserved at `docs/2026-04-22-splice-https-capture-recipe.md`)

**Domain count**: unchanged at 52.
**Enrichment YAMLs**: 107 → 120 (+13).
**Atlas pack coverage**: 0 → 641 devices indexed (614 Core Library
via auto-heuristic + 27 explicit-pack YAML declarations).
**Signature-technique coverage**: 32 → 47 enrichment files have the
`signature_techniques` field (+15 files × 3 techniques each = +45
technique entries from native-synth backfill). Coverage rose from
27% → 39% of enrichments.
**Tests**: 2644 → 2696+ (+52 new regression guards).

### Live-verified end-to-end

Against a running Ableton 12.4 + Splice desktop 5.4.9 session on
2026-04-22:

- `get_master_spectrum()` → 9 keys with `sub_low` first, real-audio
  energy distribution (`sub_low=0.0003 sub=0.0008 low=0.0064 …`)
- `atlas_pack_info("Drone Lab")` → Harmonic Drone Generator in
  both Sounds and M4L variants with URIs
- `splice_describe_sound("warm dub techno chord stab", limit=5)` →
  5 real samples out of 4100 total hits (Dub Techno 2 pluck, NEONIC
  atmos, Visions chord, Organic Elements 2, Underground Techno),
  with Splice's ML rephrasing `rephrased_query_string: "dub techno,
  chords, stabs, warm"`

### Splice HTTPS bridge — endpoint capture

Captured via mitmproxy against Splice desktop v5.4.9 (unpinned TLS,
intercepts cleanly once CA is trusted). Two GraphQL operations
wired:

- **`SamplesSearch`** at `surfaces-graphql.splice.com/graphql` —
  describe + keyword search in one operation, flagged via
  `semantic=1` + `rephrase=true`. 5938-char query embedded as
  `mcp_server/splice_client/graphql_queries/samples_search.graphql`
- **`AssetSimilarSoundsQuery`** at the same endpoint — Splice's
  "Variations" / "Similar Sounds" feature. Input is a sample
  `uuid` + `isLegacy` bool; returns up to 10 recommendations.
  886-char query embedded as
  `mcp_server/splice_client/graphql_queries/asset_similar_sounds.graphql`
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` via local gRPC `GetSession`
  RPC — no stored credentials, token rotates with the running
  Splice desktop app
- User-Agent: LivePilot default (override via env var if
  Cloudflare blocks — mimic pattern: `Splice Baelish/darwin/
  arm64/arm64 5.4.9/<hash>/stable`)
- Response normalizer `_flatten_sample_item()` is shared between
  both operations so samples from describe + variations flatten
  to identical dicts — 14 new unit tests lock this invariant
- Per-endpoint `describe_verified` / `variation_verified` flags
  replace the coarse `is_user_configured` gate

### Changed

- `splice_generate_variation` signature changed: `(file_hash,
  target_key, target_bpm, count)` → `(uuid, is_legacy)`. The
  operation is a recommender lookup, not AI audio synthesis, so
  target-key / target-bpm / count aren't API-supported. The
  underlying GraphQL returns up to 10 similar samples with the
  same flat shape as `splice_describe_sound` results.
- `splice_describe_sound` — status flipped from "scaffolded" to
  "LIVE". Adds new `rephrase: bool = True` parameter surfacing
  Splice's `rephrased_query_string` in the response.

### Added

**Sub_low spectrum band** (T3 from handoff):
- M4L Analyzer `fffb~` filter bank: 8 bands → 9 bands. New band
  center frequencies: `35 85 175 350 700 1400 2800 5600 12000`
  (Hz), with `sub_low` (20-60 Hz) prepended to separate kick
  fundamental from DC rumble
- `mcp_server/m4l_bridge.py`: `BAND_NAMES_8` + `BAND_NAMES_9`
  auto-selected based on payload length — older frozen .amxd
  builds (pre-v1.17) still work without re-freeze
- `LivePilot_Analyzer.amxd` re-frozen from modified
  `LivePilot_Analyzer.maxpat` source, 6751650 bytes, synced to
  repo / Max 9 Library cache / Ableton User Library
- `docs/2026-04-22-sub-low-band-max-workflow.md` — runbook for
  future band-count changes (Max editor walkthrough)

**Track-level arrangement automation workaround** (T5 from handoff):
- New MCP tool `set_arrangement_automation_via_session_record` —
  async two-phase protocol that creates a session clip with the
  automation, arms the track, records into arrangement at a
  target beat, cleans up
- Two new remote-script handlers:
  `arrangement_automation_via_session_record_start` returns the
  live `song.tempo` so the MCP layer can compute the sleep
  duration, `_complete` stops record + locates the new
  arrangement clip
- MCP layer sleeps `duration_beats × 60/tempo + 0.5s` with a
  600s ceiling and graceful exception handling — incomplete
  sleep still tries to complete so tracks don't stay armed
- 17 new contract tests (two-phase ordering, tempo scaling,
  ceiling, default-tempo fallback, start-failure short-circuit)

**Atlas `by_pack` index + `atlas_pack_info` tool** (T4):
- New `_by_pack` index on `AtlasManager`, populated from
  enrichment YAML `pack:` fields plus a Core Library
  auto-heuristic for native instruments/effects without an
  explicit pack declaration
- New `pack_info(name)` and `list_packs()` methods
- New MCP tool `atlas_pack_info(pack_name)` — `""` returns the
  full pack list with device counts, otherwise returns
  `{pack, device_count, enriched_count, devices[...]}` for one
  pack. Case-insensitive name lookup
- `genre_affinity` (enriched field) now feeds the `_by_genre`
  index alongside the raw `genres` field, so
  `microhouse`/`deep_minimal`/`dub_techno` tags added to YAMLs
  post-v1.11 finally surface in genre lookups

**Drum Rack atlas enrichment + 12 audio-effects YAMLs** (T1/T2):
- New `instruments/drum_rack.yaml` — treats Drum Rack as a
  meta-type container with per-pad key_parameters, 3 starter
  recipes, 8 gotchas (including MIDI pitch conventions, chain
  volume vs pad volume)
- 12 new audio-effects enrichments: `utility`, `corpus`,
  `vocoder`, `tuner`, `spectrum`, `amp`, `cabinet`, `resonators`,
  `looper`, `envelope_follower`, `audio_effect_rack`,
  `external_audio_effect`. Takes `audio_effects/` count from 40
  → 52
- Simpler + Sampler enrichments gain 3 new gotchas (Snap=OFF
  silence bug, -12 dB default, slice base pitch = 36+N)
- `pack` field added to `_ENRICHMENT_FIELDS` allowlist — was
  silently dropped from atlas JSON before; now drives the
  `by_pack` index

**Pack-knowledge reference** (T7):
- `livepilot/skills/livepilot-core/references/pack-knowledge.md`
  Tier C expanded from 7 merged clusters (~62 lines) to 14
  individually-documented packs (Build and Drop, Drive and Glow,
  Punch and Tilt, Skitter and Step, Trap Drums, Beat Tools, Drum
  Essentials, SONiVOX Orchestral Brass/Strings/Woodwinds, Grand
  Piano, Synth Essentials, Session Drums Club + Studio, Core
  Library) with consistent Essence/Scores/Top/Use/Avoid structure

**Deepened shallow enrichments** (T8):
- Added `pairs_well_with` + expanded `gotchas` +
  `signature_techniques` for: `snipper`, `bell_tower`,
  `performer`, `vector_map`, `filler`

### Concept surface — knowledge the LLM can reason over

Late-v1.17 audit found LivePilot's concept-vs-recipe ratio was already
healthy (sample-philosophy.md, sound-design-deep.md, per-device
`signature_techniques`, aesthetic-tagged `character_tags`), but two gaps
were worth closing before the release: native-synth enrichments heavy
on `starter_recipes` but thin on `signature_techniques`, and no
structured artist/genre → device-vocabulary bridge.

Added:

- **`livepilot/skills/livepilot-core/references/artist-vocabularies.md`** —
  ~25 producers (Villalobos, Hawtin/Plastikman, Basic Channel, Gas,
  Basinski, Stars of the Lid, Hecker, Aphex, Autechre, OPN, Arca,
  Dilla, Premier, Madlib, Burial, Mala, Jeff Mills, Moodymann, Daft
  Punk, Rashad, Photek, Com Truise, Boards of Canada, etc.) with
  four-field structured entries (sonic fingerprint / reach for /
  avoid / key techniques). Each entry cross-references
  `signature_techniques` in per-device YAML or technique names in
  `sample-techniques.md` / `sound-design-deep.md` — no duplication,
  just a translation layer from producer names to LivePilot devices
- **`livepilot/skills/livepilot-core/references/genre-vocabularies.md`** —
  15 genres (microhouse, dub_techno, deep_minimal, minimal_techno,
  ambient, idm, modern_classical, hip_hop, trap, dubstep, house,
  dnb, garage, experimental, synthwave) with tempo / kick / bass /
  percussion / harmonic / texture / reach-for / avoid structure.
  Read-before-tool-selection reference for genre-driven workflows
- **Native-synth `signature_techniques` backfill** — 15 YAMLs that
  had starter_recipes but no aesthetic-level guidance now have 3
  techniques each, tagged to known producers (Hawtin subtractive pad,
  303 acid bass, Reese bass for DnB, J Dilla micro-timed kit, Villalobos
  sub-bass layer, Basinski tape degradation, Tim Hecker grain cloud,
  etc.). Files updated: analog, operator, wavetable, drift, collision,
  tension, electric, simpler, sampler, bass, poli, emit, meld,
  vector_fm, vector_grain
- **`mcp_server/atlas/device_techniques_index.json`** — auto-generated
  reverse-index of 146 device→technique cross-references across 58
  devices, mined from per-device `signature_techniques` +
  `sample-techniques.md` + `sound-design-deep.md`

### Docs

- `docs/2026-04-22-release-verification.md` — end-to-end
  verification report with live-verified evidence per task
- `docs/2026-04-22-splice-https-capture-recipe.md` — mitmproxy
  runbook for capturing additional Splice GraphQL operations
- `docs/2026-04-22-live-api-probe-arrangement-automation.md` —
  design rationale for the T5 two-phase split
- `docs/2026-04-22-sub-low-band-max-workflow.md` — Max
  editor runbook for future filter-bank edits
- `docs/manual/index.md` — rewrote domain map from source-of-truth
  per-domain counts (was drifting 30+ entries). Added 7 missing
  domains (scales, grooves, take_lanes, follow_actions, miditool,
  diagnostics, synthesis_brain)
- `docs/manual/tool-reference.md` — new sections for Device Atlas,
  Sample Engine & Splice, Diagnostics; added v1.17 tools
  (`atlas_pack_info`, `set_arrangement_automation_via_session_record`,
  `splice_http_diagnose`, `splice_describe_sound` LIVE,
  `splice_generate_variation` LIVE); added `add_drum_rack_pad` +
  `verify_device_alive` + `verify_all_devices_health` that were
  missing since v1.16
- `docs/manual/tool-catalog.md` — replaced hand-curated drifting
  version with single auto-generated file (run
  `python3 scripts/generate_tool_catalog.py > docs/manual/tool-catalog.md`).
  Retired `docs/manual/tool-catalog-generated.md` (duplicate
  with -generated suffix)
- **Deleted**: `docs/TOOL_REFERENCE.md` (v1.7-era, 317 tools /
  43 domains — misleadingly stale)
- **Archived**: `docs/manual/release-smoke-board.md` → `docs/archive/release-smoke-board-v1.10-era.md`

### Internal

- `mcp_server/splice_client/graphql_queries/` — new directory,
  holds captured `.graphql` query strings, loaded lazily via
  `_load_graphql_query()` with caching
- `docs/research/splice-api-capture/` — gitignored local archive
  of 4 operation captures (request + response pairs):
  `SamplesSearch`, `SoundsSearchAutocomplete`,
  `RefreshSamplePreview`, `AssetSimilarSoundsQuery`
- 5 additional GraphQL operations captured but not wired —
  candidates for future tools: `DesktopPackSearch`,
  `SampleAssetSidebarQuery`, `BrowseCarousels`,
  `CreditsStoreQuery`, `UserService`

### Known non-blockers

- Splice Search-with-Sound (audio-file reference search) is
  retired — feature not exposed in Splice desktop v5.4.9's UI,
  user handles it manually. Recipe preserved if a future Splice
  build re-exposes it.
- T5 live end-to-end verification in a real Ableton session
  deferred — contract tests (17) lock the protocol; first real
  invocation will confirm Live LOM assumptions (classic
  v1.16.0 → v1.16.1 pattern — any surprises fix in one edit).
- `splice_http_diagnose` token-availability probe reported a
  false negative pre-1.17 (walked the wrong context path); fixed
  to use `ctx.lifespan_context["splice_client"]` + actually call
  `fetch_session_token`.


## 1.16.1 — Post-publish live-verification bug sweep (April 22 2026)

Three rounds of live verification after 1.16.0 shipped caught five
runtime bugs that unit tests missed. All unit-test-clean paths that
failed on first live invocation against a running Splice desktop +
Ableton 12.4 are now both fixed and guarded by source-grep regression
tests. Plus one new tool and two observations addressed.

**Tool count**: 421 → 422 (+1: `verify_all_devices_health` —
session-wide silent-track detector).
**Domain count**: unchanged at 52.
**Tests**: 2627 → 2644 (+17 new regression guards). No regressions.

### Live-verified bugs fixed

- `add_drum_rack_pad` crashed with `ImportError` on first invocation
  — inline `from .._analyzer_engine.sample import ...` resolved to
  `mcp_server._analyzer_engine` (nonexistent; the real package is
  `mcp_server.tools._analyzer_engine`). The helper is already imported
  at module scope on line 29; inline form removed.
- `splice_preview_sample` returned "No preview URL available" for
  un-downloaded catalog samples. `SampleInfo` RPC only carries
  `PreviewURL` for downloaded/purchased items. Now falls back to
  `SearchSamples(FileHash=...)` which always has catalog metadata.
- `splice_pack_info` crashed with
  `AttributeError: 'AppStub' object has no attribute 'SamplePackInfo'`.
  The `SamplePackInfoRequest/Response` messages exist in the proto
  descriptor but no RPC on the `App` service binds them. Rewrote to
  paginate `ListSamplePacks` + client-side UUID match. Limitation
  documented: only finds packs the user has engaged with.
- `splice_pack_info` on an OWNED pack with an extended-format UUID
  (43 chars, e.g. `...887a0dd7f26bf5a3951`) failed because the first
  fix aggressively truncated to `[:36]`, discarding legitimate bytes.
  Correct behavior: Splice uses both UUID formats; build a `targets`
  set of the submitted form AND its canonical truncation, match each
  server-returned UUID in both forms.
- Startup warning `STARTUP SELF-TEST WARNING — returned 385 tools,
  expects 422`. `_get_all_tools()` took the first non-empty probe,
  which could be a stale `_tool_manager._tools` view lagging behind
  the authoritative `_local_provider._components`. Now takes the
  largest view across all probes.
- Startup `RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'FastMCP.list_tools' was never
  awaited` on every server import. The `list_tools` probe wrapped an
  async coroutine in `list()` without awaiting. Removed with an
  explanatory comment.

### Added

- `verify_all_devices_health(test_midi_note=60, skip_audio_tracks=True,
  skip_empty_tracks=True, threshold=0.005)` — session-wide silent-
  track detector. Fires a test note on every eligible track and reports
  alive / dead / skipped with per-track peak-level evidence.
- `~/.livepilot/splice.json` config key `plan_kind_override` — pin
  the Splice plan_kind when the gRPC classifier lands on a safe
  default (e.g. `sounds_plan_id=6` with empty `features` map is
  classified as SOUNDS_PLUS but may actually be any of several tiers).
  Values: `ableton_live`, `sounds_plus`, `creator`, `creator_plus`,
  `free`. `get_splice_credits` response now includes
  `plan_kind_override: <value|null>`.

### Internal

- M4L bridge source (`livepilot_bridge.js`) ping version drift
  `1.14.1 → 1.16.1` (source had been stale; binary had already been
  patched in a prior release).
- `SpliceGRPCClient.get_pack_info` return signature changed from
  `Optional[SplicePack]` to `tuple[Optional[SplicePack], Optional[str]]`.
  Callers now receive a structured error message when the lookup
  fails, instead of `None` swallowing the cause.

## 1.16.0 — Minimal-techno session bug batch + Splice plan model (April 22 2026)

Hardens the 1.15.0 beta into a full release. Resolves 18 of the 19 bugs
catalogued in `docs/2026-04-22-bugs-discovered.md` during an end-to-end
minimal-techno production session, ships a plan-aware Splice download
model, adds drum-rack pad-by-pad construction, and lands clip-length +
note-range invariants so programmatic workflows stop corrupting
arrangement timing.

**Tool count**: 403 → 421 (+18).
**Domain count**: unchanged at 52.
**Tests**: 49 new contract tests across five helper modules. No regressions.

### Added

**Drum Rack pad-by-pad construction (BUG #1)**
- `add_drum_rack_pad(track_index, pad_note, file_path)` — atomic tool
  that does the full drum-rack build per pad: insert_rack_chain →
  set_drum_chain_note → insert empty Simpler → load sample via native
  Live 12.4 replace_sample with nested addressing. Returns
  `{ok, chain_index, pad_note, nested_device_index}`. Requires Live 12.4+.
- `replace_simpler_sample` and `load_sample_to_simpler` now accept
  `chain_index` + `nested_device_index` for deep addressing inside
  drum-rack chains.
- Auto-increment of `in_note` on `insert_rack_chain` for drum racks
  (BUG #13) — no more "all new chains pile up on note 36 (Multi)".

**Live-session device-alive verification (BUG #19)**
- `verify_device_alive(track_index, device_index)` — static check
  returning `{alive, reason, recommendation}` based on parameter_count
  and health_flags.
- Optional `fire_test_note=True` path for definitive answer: captures
  pre-hit RMS, fires a scratch MIDI clip, samples the meter over the
  duration, captures post-hit RMS. Scratch clip auto-cleaned.
- Remote Script handlers: `fire_test_note`, `cleanup_test_note`.

**Splice plan-aware download gating (2026-04-14 carry-over)**
- `SpliceGRPCClient.decide_download` with three branches: free samples
  bypass, Ableton Live plan uses daily quota, credit-metered plans use
  credit floor. Fixes the bug where the Ableton Live plan (100/day
  unmetered) was blocked by the credit-floor check.
- `DailyQuotaTracker` persisting `~/.livepilot/splice_quota.json` keyed
  by UTC date. 100/day default, 90 warn threshold.
- `classify_plan` reads feature flags (ableton_unmetered,
  ableton_live_plan, unmetered_downloads, creator_plus) with precedence
  locked down by regression-trap tests.

**Splice HTTPS bridge scaffolding**
- `mcp_server/splice_client/http_bridge.py` — auth + endpoint +
  retry/timeout plumbing for the plugin-exclusive Describe-a-Sound and
  Variations features. Tools return a clear "bridge not yet wired"
  error until the real endpoint shapes are captured via mitmproxy.

**Extended analyzer perception**
- `analyze_loudness_live` (BUG #8) — LUFS + true-peak on the live
  master without requiring a file render.
- `get_master_spectrum` now accepts `window_ms` (BUG #6) — stable
  averaged reads vs the previous single-sample jitter.

**Clip length + note-range invariants (BUG #1c)**
- `create_clip(length=N)` now forces `loop_end = N` and `end_marker = N`
  after creation. Response exposes both fields.
- `add_notes` auto-extends `loop_end` if any incoming note's
  `start_time + duration` exceeds it. Response reports
  `loop_end_extended_to` when extension fired.

**Smart Simpler defaults (BUG #17 + #18)**
- `load_browser_item(role=...)` applies post-load Simpler defaults:
  - `drum`:    Snap=0, Vol=0dB, Trigger Mode=0 (Trigger), root=C1 (36)
  - `melodic`: Snap=1, Vol=0dB, Trigger Mode=1 (Gate), root=C3 (60)
  - `texture`: Snap=0, Vol=-6dB, Trigger Mode=1 (Gate), root=C3 (60)

**Miscellaneous**
- `get_track_info(-1000)` returns master track info (BUG #11).
- `scan_full_library(max_per_category=5000)` — removed the hardcoded
  1000 cap that silently truncated large categories (BUG #12).
- `batch_set_parameters` accepts `{index: N, value}` and `{name: "X", value}`
  shapes — the keys `get_device_parameters` actually returns (BUG #3).
- `search_browser` / `search_samples` accept intuitive parameter aliases
  (BUG #4).
- `get_browser_items` paginates when output would exceed the token cap
  (BUG #5).
- `get_track_meters` returns consistent peak/L/R triple on a single time
  window (BUG #7).
- `set_song_scale` accepts string root notes ("C", "F#", "Bb") and
  handles Live 12.4.0's moved `scale_names` attribute via a tolerant
  resolver with a built-in fallback scale list (BUG #2).

### Documentation

- `docs/load_browser_item-uri-grammar.md` (BUG #14) — the three URI
  forms, failure modes, discovery recipe, top-level folder map. Moved
  under `livepilot/skills/livepilot-devices/references/`.
- `livepilot-devices` SKILL — new "Custom Drum Rack Construction" and
  "Parameter Name Quirks" sections (BUG #10, #16).
- `livepilot-arrangement` SKILL — documents the Live LOM limitation
  behind BUG #1b (programmatic arrangement automation) with two
  workaround patterns (session-clip + record, or stepped section
  clips).
- `docs/M4L_BRIDGE.md` — drift fixes: bridge command count 28 → 30,
  analyzer MCP tool count 20 → 33, Max 8 → Max 9 reference, new
  Phase 3 section documenting 8 previously undocumented bridge
  commands.

### Fixed

- `_live_caps` no longer caches the 12.0.0 fallback when
  `get_session_info` returns no live_version — previously pinned the
  entire session to the oldest capability tier.

### Changed

- `insert_rack_chain` on drum racks now auto-increments `in_note`
  (BUG #13). Pass `auto_pad_note=false` to keep Live's default
  collide-on-36 behavior.

### Deferred

- **BUG #15** — adding a sub_low (30-60 Hz) spectrum band requires a
  Max 9 re-freeze of `LivePilot_Analyzer.amxd`. Deferred to the next
  .amxd rebuild cycle. `get_mel_spectrum` provides finer-grained
  perceptual bands as a workaround.
- **BUG #1b** — programmatic creation of arrangement automation
  breakpoints. Live LOM limitation (per Ableton docs,
  `Clip.automation_envelope` returns None for arrangement clips);
  documented workaround patterns instead of a synthetic fix.

### Platform

- LivePilot_Analyzer.amxd ping version bytes patched 1.15.0 → 1.16.0
  (in-place binary patch — source bumps don't auto-refresh the frozen
  JS, lesson from two prior releases).

## 1.15.0-beta — Live 12.4 replace_sample native (April 21 2026)

First Live 12.4 beta support release. Adds a native fast path for
SimplerDevice.replace_sample(path) while preserving 100% backward
compatibility for 12.0-12.3.x users.

**Tool count**: unchanged at 403.
**Domain count**: unchanged at 52.
**Tests**: 2503 passed, 1 skipped, 0 regressions (+13 new from this release).

### Added
- **Live 12.4 support (beta):** `SimplerDevice.replace_sample(path)` native
  LOM path is now used automatically on Live 12.4+. Handles empty Simplers —
  fixes the long-standing workaround documented in
  `feedback_load_browser_item_is_source_of_truth.md`.
- New capability tier `"collaborative"` (Live 12.4+) exposed via
  `LiveVersionCapabilities.capability_tier` and `.has_replace_sample_native`.
- Remote Script: new `replace_sample_native` handler.
- MCP server: new `_live_caps(ctx)` helper with lazy version-capability
  caching on the lifespan context.
- Registered `replace_sample_native` in `mcp_server/runtime/remote_commands.py`
  REMOTE_COMMANDS (required by the boundary audit contract).

### Changed
- `replace_simpler_sample` and `load_sample_to_simpler` now route to the
  native path when available and fall back to the M4L-bridge path
  otherwise. Tool signatures, argument names, and return shapes unchanged.

### Backward Compatibility
- Live 12.0–12.3.x: zero behavior change. All routing still goes through
  the M4L bridge.
- Live 12.4+: native path preferred; bridge used only on fallback.

### Verification status
- Full test suite: 2503 passed, 0 failures.
- Backward compat on Live 12.4: verified in-session — `replace_simpler_sample`
  and `load_sample_to_simpler` both work via the bridge path on 12.4 (legacy
  flow intact).
- Native E2E on Live 12.4 empty-Simpler case: deferred until the plugin
  swap activates the worktree's MCP code. Unit tests prove the routing
  logic and the native handler wiring.

## 1.14.1 — reload_handlers workflow + device/mixing fixes (April 21 2026)

Patch release that lands the post-1.14.0 audit work: one new diagnostics
tool, three bug fixes, and a new plugin-sync verification script.

**Tool count**: 402 → **403** (added `reload_handlers`).
**Domain count**: unchanged at 52.
**Tests**: 2467 → **2485 passing** (+18 new), 0 regressions.

### New tool: `reload_handlers`

- Replaces the manual "toggle Control Surface in Live → Preferences →
  Link/MIDI" step that every Remote Script edit required. New workflow:
  after `npx livepilot --install`, call `reload_handlers` via the MCP
  tool. The Remote Script side uses `pkgutil` + `importlib.reload()` to
  re-fire all `@register` decorators in place in <1s, without dropping
  the MCP TCP connection on port 9878.
- Ships with a pkgutil-based module-discovery helper in
  `remote_script/LivePilot/__init__.py`, so new handler modules added to
  `remote_script/LivePilot/` are picked up automatically on reload.
- Exception: the very first bootstrap (no prior `LivePilot.*` in
  `sys.modules`) still needs one full Ableton restart. After that,
  `reload_handlers` works forever.
- Domain: `diagnostics`. Added to `docs/manual/tool-catalog.md` to keep
  the CI skill-contract test green.

### Bug fixes

- **`find_and_load_device` duplicate loads** — the tool was no-oping
  only on exact name match; changed to also treat cases where the
  target device is already the tail of the chain as a no-op. Prevents
  the "load Simpler, load Simpler, load Simpler" cascade when the MCP
  server retries a loader.
- **`get_device_parameters` "Invalid display value"** — certain Live
  parameters (especially plugin wrappers on AU/VST) raise
  `RuntimeError("Invalid display value")` when their
  `str_for_value()` is queried before the parameter has settled. The
  handler now swallows that specific error and returns the raw float
  instead of 500-ing the whole request.
- **Sidechain LOM reopen (BUG-A3 redux)** — Compressor2 moved its
  sidechain block into a nested property in a recent Live update, so
  `compressor_set_sidechain` lost the ability to toggle. The handler
  now probes the LOM surface at tool-call time and falls back to the
  flat path when the nested one isn't exposed.
- **Mixing `channel` lazy-get** — channel objects were resolved eagerly
  at import time, breaking in edge cases where the Song came up before
  the mixer. Now resolved on first use.

### New: plugin-sync verification

- `scripts/verify_plugin_sync.py` — catches the v1.14.0 regression
  class where `.mcp.json` went missing from
  `~/.claude/plugins/cache/dreamrec-LivePilot/livepilot/$VERSION/`. All
  four sync targets (active plugin dir, cache version dir, marketplace
  snapshot, `installed_plugins.json`) are now verified by one command.

---

## 1.14.0 — Branch-native v2: producer context, synth intelligence, render verify (April 20 2026)

Five-PR follow-up to v1.13.0 that closes the loops the first pass left
open. Producer context flows through the branch lifecycle via a versioned
`producer_payload`; synthesis adapters decode algorithm topology instead
of always targeting the same operator; composer winners commit the full
resolved plan instead of the audition scaffold; render-verify captures
audio before/after each branch and feeds spectral movement into the
hard-rule classifier; and four dedicated MCP tools expose the new
producers to the LLM.

**Tool count**: 398 → **402** (added `analyze_synth_patch`,
`propose_synth_branches`, `extract_timbre_fingerprint`,
`propose_composer_branches`). **Domain count**: unchanged at 52.
**Tests**: 2409 → **2467 passing** (+58 new), 0 regressions.

### New substrate

- **`producer_payload: dict` on `BranchSeed`** (PR1) — versioned
  opaque dict producers populate with regeneration / provenance /
  winner-escalation context. Always carries `schema_version` (default 1)
  so older payloads don't break newer readers. Lives on the seed, not
  `compiled_plan`, so analytical-only branches can carry context too.
  Canonical shapes documented per producer (synthesis / composer /
  semantic_move / freeform / technique).

- **`BranchSnapshot` gains render-based fields** (PR4) —
  `capture_path`, `loudness`, `spectral_shape`, `fingerprint`. Populated
  only when `run_experiment(render_verify=True)` opts in. Pre-v2
  consumers see no shape change when render-verify is off.

### Synthesis adapters get topology awareness (PR2)

- **Wavetable**: position→region classification (sub / mid / bright /
  complex) drives shift direction. Target brightness biases the chosen
  target region — not just freshness scaling.

- **Operator**: static `_ALGO_TOPOLOGY` table maps all 11 algorithms
  to their carrier/modulator roles. Targeting picks the modulator with
  the highest Level for the ratio shift; additive algorithms (5, 9)
  fall back to the dominant carrier. No more "always Osc B".

- **Analog / Drift / Meld**: single fixed proposers become strategy
  registries. Gates honor `role_hint` ("bass" skips `detune_warmth`,
  "pad" skips `filter_pluck`, silent engines skip `engine_mix_shift`)
  and target fingerprint dimensions (`target.brightness` picks
  `filter_sweep_open` vs `filter_sweep_close`).

### Composer winner escalation (PR3)

- Composer seeds now carry their `CompositionIntent` in
  `producer_payload` at emit time. On `commit_experiment`,
  `escalate_composer_branch` rehydrates the intent and runs the full
  `ComposerEngine.compose()` pipeline — Splice / filesystem / browser
  sample resolution — then swaps the scaffold plan for the resolved one
  BEFORE `commit_branch_async` runs it through the async router. The
  scaffold is preserved on `branch.evaluation` for audit.

- Graceful fallback when compose yields zero executable layers:
  commit runs the scaffold instead of erroring. User gets tracks +
  scenes they can populate manually, with `composer_escalation.error`
  explaining why escalation couldn't complete.

- **Latency note**: composer winner commit now takes 10-30s (Splice +
  filesystem resolution) vs ~0.5s pre-v2. Documented; a progress
  callback version is future work.

### Render-verify + classifier wiring (PR4)

- `run_experiment(render_verify=False, render_duration_seconds=2.0)` —
  opt-in per-branch audio capture → offline loudness + spectrum
  analysis → `TimbralFingerprint` extraction. ~2 * duration seconds +
  ~1-2s analysis overhead per branch; default off preserves speed.

- New `derive_goal_progress_from_fingerprint(diff, target?)` turns
  TimbralFingerprint diffs into `(goal_progress, measurable_count)`.
  Dimensions below 0.02 epsilon are dropped as noise. With a target:
  sign(target) * diff gives signed progress. Without: magnitude-only
  contribution (branch moved = measurable).

- `classify_branch_outcome` accepts `fingerprint_diff` + `timbral_target`
  kwargs. When set and caller didn't supply their own measurable inputs,
  the classifier derives them from the diff. Caller-supplied values
  still take precedence (back-compat). Protection violations still
  trump fingerprint evidence — safety invariant preserved.

- `compare_experiments` automatically surfaces `fingerprint_diff` +
  `fingerprint_before` + `fingerprint_after` on each branch's
  `evaluation` dict via the existing pass-through.

### Four new MCP tools (PR5, 398 → 402)

- **`analyze_synth_patch(track_index, device_index, role_hint="")`** —
  SynthProfile for any supported native synth. Fetches parameter state
  + display values, hands to the adapter. Opaque fallback for
  non-supported devices.

- **`propose_synth_branches(track_index, device_index, target?,
  freshness?, role_hint?)`** — algorithm/topology-aware branch seeds
  with pre-compiled plans. Feeds directly to
  `create_experiment(seeds=..., compiled_plans=...)`.

- **`extract_timbre_fingerprint(spectrum?, loudness?, spectral_shape?)`**
  — pure transform from analysis dicts to 9-dimensional
  `TimbralFingerprint`. For callers that already have analysis data.

- **`propose_composer_branches(request_text, count=2, freshness=0.65)`**
  — N compositional hypotheses (canonical / energy_shift /
  layer_contrast) with producer_payload-captured intents for
  winner-commit escalation.

### Migration notes for callers

- All additions are optional-param / new-function shaped. Pre-v2
  callers see no behavior change unless they opt in.
- Pre-v2 serialized branches deserialize fine: `producer_payload`
  defaults to `{"schema_version": 1}` when absent.
- `create_experiment(move_ids=...)` identical behavior.
- `enter_wonder_mode` response shape stable; `branch_seeds` /
  `compiled_plans_by_seed_id` still additive.
- `run_experiment(render_verify=False)` default matches v1.13.0
  behavior exactly.

### Known limitations

See [`docs/manual/branch-native-migration.md`](docs/manual/branch-native-migration.md#known-limitations)
for the full list. Headlines:

- Wavetable region classification is a coarse heuristic on raw
  `Osc 1 Pos`. Future work: render-based per-wavetable mapping.
- Composer commit latency (10-30s) with no progress callback yet.
- Render-verify requires the M4L analyzer bridge + LivePilot_Analyzer
  on master; silently degrades to fast-path when either is missing.
- End-to-end render-verify path (capture_audio + bridge) is hardware-
  dependent and not unit-tested; wiring is covered via classifier +
  fingerprint derivation tests.

## 1.13.0 — Branch-native architecture (April 20 2026)

Twelve-PR migration from "match request → pick move → compile move" to
"understand intent → generate branches → compile branches → compare".
The planning layer opens up — Wonder, Preview Studio, Experiment, and
the new synthesis_brain all share one BranchSeed + CompiledBranch
contract. Move-first is still available as a targeted flow; branch-native
is the canonical exploratory path.

**No tool count change** (still 398). **Domain count 51 → 52**
(added `synthesis_brain`). **+175 new tests** across 9 new files
(2206 → 2387 passing, 1 skipped, 0 failures).

### New substrate (additive, non-breaking)

- **`mcp_server/branches/`** (PR1) — shared `BranchSeed` and
  `CompiledBranch` types with `seed_from_move_id` / `freeform_seed` /
  `analytical_seed` factories. `BranchSeed` sources:
  `semantic_move` / `freeform` / `synthesis` / `composer` / `technique`.
- **SessionKernel creative controls** (PR2) — `freshness`,
  `creativity_profile`, `sacred_elements`, `synth_hints` added as
  optional fields on `SessionKernel` and `get_session_kernel`. Legacy
  callers see zero behavior change.
- **ExperimentBranch compat shim** (PR3) — `move_id` now optional;
  new `ExperimentBranch.from_seed()` classmethod and
  `create_experiment_from_seeds(seeds=[...], compiled_plans=[...])`
  entry point. Legacy `create_experiment(move_ids=...)` keeps working
  and internally delegates via `seed_from_move_id`.
- **Creative conductor fork** (PR4) — `classify_request_creative()`
  alongside `classify_request()`. Adds producer selection
  (`branch_sources`, `seed_hints`) based on request content + kernel state.
- **`interesting_but_failed` branch status** (PR7) — new
  `classify_branch_outcome()` in `evaluation/policy.py`. Exploration
  mode downgrades score / measurable-delta failures to
  `interesting_but_failed`; protection violations still force undo
  (safety invariant).
- **Per-goal-mode novelty bands** (PR8) — TasteGraph's single
  `novelty_band` is now a view over `novelty_bands["improve"]`; the
  `explore` band lets surprise-me branch generation disconnect from
  conservative improve-mode history. `bypass_taste_in_generation` flag
  makes `rank_moves` return uniform scores.

### Branch-native producers

- **Wonder branch assembler** (PR6) — `generate_branch_seeds()` emits
  seeds from four sources: semantic_move, technique (session memory),
  sacred-element inversion (freshness-gated), and corpus hints.
  `enter_wonder_mode` now surfaces `branch_seeds` alongside variants.
- **`synthesis_brain/` subsystem** (PR9, PR10) — native-synth-aware
  branch production with adapters for Wavetable, Operator, Analog,
  Drift, Meld. `analyze_synth_patch()` / `propose_synth_branches()`
  callable from Python; `extract_timbre_fingerprint()` builds a
  TimbralFingerprint from 8-band spectrum + optional FluCoMa
  descriptors. No MCP tools yet — next release will wire dedicated
  tools and do the tool-count metadata sweep in one pass.
- **Composer branch producer** (PR11) — `propose_composer_branches()`
  emits N distinct compositional hypotheses from one prompt via three
  strategies (canonical / energy_shift / layer_contrast), gated on
  freshness. Each branch ships a pre-compiled scaffolding plan.

### Docs refactor

- **Skills + command guides thinned** (PR5) — `livepilot-core/SKILL.md`
  now presents two peer flows (Flow A targeted / Flow B exploratory)
  instead of one recipe-first pipeline. `arrange` / `beat` / `mix` /
  `sounddesign` commands each add a short Branch-Native section.
- **Branch status vocabulary** documented including
  `interesting_but_failed` retention semantics.

### Migration notes for callers

- All additions are optional-param / new-function shaped. Any code
  reading `branch.move_id` keeps working because `ExperimentBranch`
  mirrors `seed.move_id` there. Any code calling
  `create_experiment(move_ids=...)` keeps its exact behavior.
- If you have persistent state on disk (`~/.livepilot/taste.json`):
  v1.13 migrates `novelty_band` (flat float) to `novelty_bands` (dict)
  on first read. Old clients reading the file still see the flat field.
- Tests added across 9 new files — no existing test needed editing
  beyond `test_experiment_engine.py` (which gains PR3 coverage but
  keeps every pre-PR3 test passing).

## 1.12.2 — Post-release audit reliability fixes (April 18 2026)

Six issues surfaced by an immediate post-v1.12.0 deep audit (parallel
code-reviewer subagents + manual verification). All fixed TDD-style —
every bug now has a named regression guard in the test suite.

**No tool count change** (still 398). **+11 regression tests**
(2195 → 2206 passing, 1 skipped, 0 failed).

### Critical fixes (reliability in hot paths)

- **`send_capture` no longer blocks `send_command`** (BUG-audit-C1).
  The M4L bridge shared `_cmd_lock` between `send_capture` and
  `send_command`, so any concurrent MCP tool invocation during a
  recording was blocked for the full capture duration (up to 35s).
  The two operations use independent receiver state
  (`_capture_future` vs `_response_callback`) and now use
  independent locks (`_capture_lock` + `_cmd_lock`).
  [`mcp_server/m4l_bridge.py:780-790, 912-913`](mcp_server/m4l_bridge.py).
- **`_parse_osc` no longer crashes on malformed packets**
  (BUG-audit-C2). `data.index(b'\x00')` raised `ValueError` when a
  packet had no null byte — on UDP port 9880 collision with
  non-OSC traffic, every incoming packet logged a noisy stack
  trace. Replaced with `data.find(...)` + bounds checks on every
  offset; malformed packets drop silently.
  [`mcp_server/m4l_bridge.py:513-565`](mcp_server/m4l_bridge.py).
- **`classify_simpler_slices` returns structured error on bad WAV**
  (BUG-audit-C3). `sf.read()` was unguarded — corrupt or missing
  files raised `soundfile.LibsndfileError` through the MCP
  framework as an internal server error. Every other tool in the
  module returns `{"error": ...}` dicts. Now wrapped in
  `try/except` for consistent error shape.
  [`mcp_server/tools/analyzer.py:571-581`](mcp_server/tools/analyzer.py).

### High-severity fixes (API consistency)

- **`batch_set_parameters` rejects negative `parameter_index`**
  (BUG-audit-H3). `set_device_parameter` validates this at the MCP
  layer; `batch_set_parameters` didn't, leaking an unstructured
  `IndexError` from the Remote Script. Now rejected with a clear
  ValueError at normalisation time.
  [`mcp_server/tools/devices.py:318-328`](mcp_server/tools/devices.py).

### Medium-severity fixes

- **`_enrich_slice_response` uses positional fallback for missing
  `index` field** (BUG-audit-M2). Direct `s["index"]` access in a
  list comprehension raised `KeyError` on bridge version skew.
  Now uses `s.get("index", i)` with `enumerate` fallback.
  [`mcp_server/tools/analyzer.py:57-62`](mcp_server/tools/analyzer.py).
- **`test_identify_returns_none_for_free_port` is no longer flaky**
  (BUG-audit-M4). The test hardcoded port 59999 as "almost
  certainly free"; when another process on the machine held it
  (hitting Claude Desktop during the audit), the test failed
  without diagnosing a real code bug. Now uses
  `socket.bind(("127.0.0.1", 0))` to get a kernel-assigned free
  port, releases it, then verifies.
  [`tests/test_startup_safety.py:50-70`](tests/test_startup_safety.py).

### .amxd binary patched in place

- `m4l_device/LivePilot_Analyzer.amxd` had the `ping` response
  version string patched from `"1.12.0"` → `"1.12.2"` via direct
  byte replacement (same-length delta, size preserved). No Max
  re-export needed.
- `m4l_device/livepilot_bridge.js` source version also updated for
  the next full rebuild.

## 1.12.1 — Silent-failure fixes + slice classifier (April 18 2026)

Reconciles the "separate git stash" called out under v1.12.0's Known
limitations — the 2026-04-18 minimal-groove session surfaced four
silent-failure bugs and the need for a drum-slice spectral classifier.

**+1 tool (397 → 398): `classify_simpler_slices`.** +43 regression
guards (pure-Python, run without a live Ableton).

### Ship-stoppers fixed

- **`get_master_rms.pitch.midi_note` clamped** (BUG-F1) — polyphonic
  pitch detector emitted values up to 319.15 with amplitude 0. Now
  drops readings with zero amplitude or out-of-range MIDI.
  [`mcp_server/tools/analyzer.py:128-147`](mcp_server/tools/analyzer.py).
- **`get_simpler_slices` discloses base MIDI pitch** (BUG-F2) — Simpler
  Slice mode uses C1 (MIDI 36) as slice 0, NOT C3. Response now
  includes `base_midi_pitch` at top level and `midi_pitch` per slice.
  Prevents the class of silent-audio bugs where MIDI notes at pitch
  60+ trigger nothing. Docstring updated to mandate using the
  returned `midi_pitch`.
  [`mcp_server/tools/analyzer.py:37-62, 462-487`](mcp_server/tools/analyzer.py).
- **`delete_track` last-track error message** (BUG-F3) — Ableton's
  default rejection message was unrelated to the real cause ("you
  can't add notes to a clip that doesn't exist yet"). Now pre-checks
  `track_count` and raises a clear ValueError.
  [`mcp_server/tools/tracks.py:93-112`](mcp_server/tools/tracks.py).
- **`batch_set_parameters` accepts aligned schema** (BUG-F4) — supports
  `parameter_index` / `parameter_name` (matching `set_device_parameter`)
  in addition to the legacy `name_or_index`. Rejects ambiguous entries
  with clear errors.
  [`mcp_server/tools/devices.py:292-328`](mcp_server/tools/devices.py).

### New tool

- **`classify_simpler_slices(track, device, file_path?)`** — runs
  FFT-based spectral analysis on a Simpler's slice boundaries, returns
  each slice labeled as KICK / SNARE / HAT / ghost plus feature
  breakdown (peak, rms, band %). Validated thresholds from the
  2026-04-18 minimal-groove session on "Break Ghosts 90 bpm":
    - KICK: sub+low ≥ 45%, high < 40%
    - HAT: high ≥ 70% AND mid < 25%
    - SNARE: mid ≥ 25% AND high ≥ 40% AND peak ≥ 0.6
    - ghost: peak < 0.35
  Eliminates the "assume slice 0 = kick" class of bug.

### New module

- **`mcp_server/sample_engine/slice_classifier.py`** — pure-Python
  band-energy + peak classifier. Testable without Ableton
  (`tests/test_slice_classifier.py` uses synthesized drum hits).
  Exported `classify_segment()` and `classify_slices()` for direct
  use outside MCP as well.

### Documented bug entries

- `BUGS.md` gains a new **"F. 2026-04-18 minimal-groove creative
  session"** section: F1-F4 fixed here, F5-F7 scoped to v1.13+, F8
  wontfix (workaround documented).

### Not included in this release

- `package.json` / `server.json` / plugin manifests / skill tool-count
  sync — release-discipline is a separate task per CLAUDE.md's
  "Version Bump" section. Run `python3 scripts/sync_metadata.py --fix`
  before the next release.
- Registering `classify_simpler_slices` in
  `tests/test_tools_contract.py::test_analyzer_tools_registered` — the
  total-count assertion there already passes if regenerated; the
  registration list is additive and can land with the metadata sync.

## 1.12.0 — Live 12 LOM completeness (April 18 2026)

Thirteen chunks closing the gap between LivePilot and Ableton Live 12.3.6's
Live Object Model. **325 → 397 tools (+72). 45 → 51 domains (+6).**  Every
addition is hasattr-probed where the underlying API varies by Live version
— Core (12.0+), Enhanced (12.1.10+), and Full Intelligence (12.3+) tiers
keep their graceful degradation contract.

### New tools by chunk

- **Chunk 1 — Song scale awareness (4 tools):** `get_song_scale`,
  `set_song_scale`, `set_song_scale_mode`, `list_available_scales` — exposes
  Live 12.0's Scale Mode at the song level. Remote Script probes
  `song.scale_name` / `song.root_note`; missing on pre-12 falls back to
  "Scale awareness unavailable".
- **Chunk 2 — Per-clip scale override (3 tools):** `get_clip_scale`,
  `set_clip_scale`, `set_clip_scale_mode` — Live 12.0 MIDI clip-level override
  for the song scale. Honors `clip.scale_name` and `clip.scale_mode`.
- **Chunk 3 — Tuning System (4 tools):** `get_tuning_system`,
  `set_tuning_reference_pitch`, `set_tuning_note`, `reset_tuning_system` —
  Live 12.1 microtonal tuning. Writes to `song.tuning_system`,
  `tuning.reference_pitch`, and individual tuning-note cents.
- **Chunk 4 — Follow Actions (8 tools):** Clip-level Live 12.0 revamp
  (multi-action enum, `follow_action_time`, `follow_action_enabled`) +
  scene-level Live 12.2+ (`scene.follow_action`, `scene.follow_action_time`)
  + preset wrapper for "A→B→C chain" common shapes.
- **Chunk 5 — Groove Pool (7 tools):** Pool enumeration, per-clip assignment,
  master groove dial. Exposes Live 11+ `song.groove_pool` and the swing /
  timing / random / velocity amount on each groove.
- **Chunk 6 — Take Lanes (6 tools):** Enumeration, creation, per-lane clip
  creation. Live 12.0 read surface + 12.2 write surface — both paths handled
  with `hasattr` probes so older hosts degrade cleanly.
- **Chunk 7 — Rack Variations + Macro CRUD (8 tools):** Variation
  store/recall/delete + macro add/remove/randomize on Instrument/Audio-Effect
  Racks (Live 11+).
- **Chunk 8 — Sample Slice CRUD (6 tools):** `insert_slice`, `move_slice`,
  `remove_slice`, `clear_slices`, `reset_slices`, `import_slices_from_onsets`.
  Writes to `SimplerDevice.sample.slices` (Live 11+).
- **Chunk 9 — Wavetable Modulation Matrix (5 tools):** Targets,
  routing, amounts — completes the Wavetable surface alongside the existing
  parameter tools (Live 11+).
- **Chunk 10 — Song/Track long-tail primitives (12 tools):** `tap_tempo`,
  `nudge_tempo_down/up`, exclusive arm/solo, `capture_and_insert_scene`,
  `count_in`, Ableton Link state, `jump_in_session_clip`, performance-impact
  read, `appointed_device`.
- **Chunk 11 — Device A/B Compare (3 tools):** State read, toggle, copy
  direction. Uses Live 12.3+ `Device.is_ab_state_enabled` / `ab_state`
  where available; all three tools hasattr-probe so they return a clear
  "unsupported on this Live build" error on 12.2 and older.
- **Chunk 12 — ControlSurface enumeration (2 tools):** `list_control_surfaces`,
  `get_control_surface_info`. Always-available diagnostic for multi-surface
  setups.
- **Chunk 13 — MIDI Tool bridge (4 tools):** `install_miditool_device`,
  `set_miditool_target`, `get_miditool_context`, `list_miditool_generators`.
  Exposes Live 12 MIDI Tools (Generators + Transformations) backed by
  LivePilot generators (euclidean_rhythm, humanize, tintinnabuli). Ships
  with both `.amxd` files pre-built from Live's factory templates — install
  via `install_miditool_device()` which copies to the correct User Library
  subfolders. **Note**: end-to-end Max-side integration is a known
  follow-up; Max's `[js]` object may not locate `miditool_bridge.js` on
  every machine without the folder being added to Max's File Preferences →
  File Search Path. Server-side tools and config dispatch work standalone;
  full round-trip notes-in-clip requires that Max path setup. Hence:
  server shipped, Max-side user-setup step documented.

### New domains (45 → 51)

Source of truth is module layout — six new files registered @mcp.tool()
decorators:

- `mcp_server/tools/scales.py` — serves both scales (Chunks 1–2) AND tuning
  (Chunk 3) since both live on the Song object.
- `mcp_server/tools/follow_actions.py` — Chunk 4.
- `mcp_server/tools/grooves.py` — Chunk 5.
- `mcp_server/tools/take_lanes.py` — Chunk 6.
- `mcp_server/tools/diagnostics.py` — Chunk 12.
- `mcp_server/tools/miditool.py` — Chunk 13.

Chunks 7–11 extended existing domains (devices, clips) and did not introduce
new modules.

### Known limitations

- **MIDI Tool bridge (Chunk 13) — Max-side file search**: the `.amxd` files
  reference `js miditool_bridge.js` relatively. Max normally searches the
  .amxd's folder first, but Live's MIDI Tool instantiation context can
  bypass that. If `Max → Window → Max Console` shows "can't find file
  miditool_bridge.js" when you fire the tool: open Max → Options → File
  Preferences → add `~/Music/Ableton/User Library/MIDI Tools/Max Generators`
  and `~/Music/Ableton/User Library/MIDI Tools/Max Transformations` to the
  File Search Path, save, reload the device.
- A separate git stash ("pre-existing drift before LOM completeness work"
  with `classify_simpler_slices` in flight) was left intact; the user will
  reconcile it in its own release.

### Not a breaking change

Every new tool is additive. No existing tool names, parameters, or return
shapes changed. Remote Script still boots cleanly on Live 12.0 — the 12.1+
and 12.3+ tools just return `STATE_ERROR` with a clear message when the host
lacks the underlying LOM attribute.

## 1.10.9 — Second-pass audit + deferred-bugs shipped (April 18 2026)

Completes every non-feature item on the v1.10.8 audit backlog. 2116 → 2132
passing tests (+16 regression guards). 324 → 325 tools (`check_clip_key_consistency`
lands from BUG-D1). Every deferred BUG-C and BUG-D entry either ships or is
scoped to a follow-up feature; BUG-C4 is filed upstream as
[PrefectHQ/fastmcp#3967](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/issues/3967).

### Ship-stoppers fixed

- **`send_capture` phantom 35s hang when receiver is None** —
  [`mcp_server/m4l_bridge.py:441`](mcp_server/m4l_bridge.py). `send_command`
  had a receiver-None guard; `send_capture` didn't. When UDP 9880 failed
  to bind but the cache still reported connected, the OSC packet was
  sent, the capture future was never registered, and the full 35s
  timeout fired with a misleading "device may be busy" error. Added the
  matching 5-line guard so the real cause surfaces immediately.
- **`utils.py` stale after Control Surface toggle** —
  [`remote_script/LivePilot/__init__.py:43`](remote_script/LivePilot/__init__.py).
  Every handler does `from .utils import get_track, get_device`.
  `importlib.reload(devices)` rebinds those names, but because `utils`
  was not in `_HANDLER_MODULES`, the re-import resolved against the
  stale `sys.modules["LivePilot.utils"]`. Added `utils` first in the
  reload order so edits to the shared helpers pick up on toggle too,
  honoring the dev-workflow guarantee documented at the top of the file.

### New tools

- **`check_clip_key_consistency`** (BUG-D1) — parses Splice-style
  filename key tokens (`_D#min`, `_Ebmaj`, `_Cm`, …), cross-checks
  against `get_detected_key`, returns the exact `set_clip_pitch(coarse=±N)`
  call that would realign on mismatch. Handles `#`/`b` accidentals,
  `min`/`m`/`maj` suffixes, absent tokens gracefully.
- **`get_session_diagnostics(check_clip_keys=True)`** — opt-in scan
  across every audio clip, appending `clip_key_mismatch` warnings with
  the one-call fix attached.

### Features shipped

- **Session continuity persistence wired at startup** (BUG from external
  audit). `bind_project_store_from_session()` now computes a project
  fingerprint, opens the matching `ProjectStore`, AND rehydrates
  `_threads` + `_turns` from disk. Wired into `server.py` lifespan with
  a lazy rebind on first `record_turn_resolution` / `open_creative_thread`.
  Creative threads and turn history now survive server restarts — the
  README's "return to a project" claim is now load-bearing.
- **Taste-aware `propose_next_best_move`** — replaces keyword-only
  matching with `0.55 × keyword + 0.30 × taste_alignment + 0.15 ×
  (1 − avoidance) ± 0.10 × family_bonus`. Cold-start users identical to
  before; users with history get personalized ranking via
  `dimension_weights` and `dimension_avoidances`. New return fields:
  `score_breakdown`, `taste_active`, `taste_evidence_count`.
- **Evaluation `taste_fit`** — previously hardcoded to `0.0`. Now
  computed from `outcome_history` by matching same-direction deltas on
  the same dimensions: ±0.2 per kept/undone match, neutral 0.5 baseline.
- **`AutomationGraph.coverage_pct`** (BUG-D2, detection half) — new
  fields `coverage_pct`, `clip_envelope_count`, `clips_scanned`
  distinguish "no automation exists" from "we couldn't probe" from
  "sparse but present". Surfaced in `get_project_brain_summary` as
  `automation_coverage_pct`.

### Refactor (BUG-C1)

- **`mcp_server/tools/analyzer.py`** 1069 → 913 LOC. All 32
  `@mcp.tool()` decorators stay in the module (FastMCP registration
  order unchanged), helpers moved to `_analyzer_engine/`:
  `context.py` (SpectralCache/bridge accessors, analyzer health check),
  `sample.py` (Simpler post-load hygiene, filename heuristics),
  `flucoma.py` (FluCoMa hint text, pitch-name table). Same
  package-facade pattern as `_composition_engine` and `_agent_os_engine`.
- **`sync_metadata::get_domains()` now skips `_*`** directories + files
  under `mcp_server/tools/`. Matches Python private-package convention,
  prevents internal helpers from registering as false domains.

### Resilience (BUG-C3)

- **`_get_all_tools()` probe chain extended** in `mcp_server/server.py`
  to 4 paths: existing `_tool_manager._tools` and
  `_local_provider._components`, plus speculative 3.3+ rename
  `_local_provider._tools` and the future public `mcp.list_tools()`.
  Each wrapped in try/except. All-empty fall-through now prints
  `fastmcp.__version__` + the attempted probe labels — prior silent `[]`
  return would disable schema coercion with no signal.
- **New `_assert_tool_registry_accessible()`** self-test runs at module
  import. Empty registry or a count mismatch against
  `tests/test_tools_contract.py` fails loudly via stderr.

### Upstream (BUG-C4)

- **FastMCP feature request filed** —
  [PrefectHQ/fastmcp#3967](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/issues/3967)
  "Feature request: public tool-enumeration API". Migration is a
  no-op once upstream lands a `mcp.list_tools()` or `mcp.tools`
  surface — the probe chain already anticipates both.

### Metadata + docs

- **`sync_metadata.py` extended** — catches both `N tools` and hyphenated
  `N-tool`, now covers `manifest.json` + `docs/manual/intelligence.md` +
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. New prose-claim checks for
  bridge-command count, enriched-device YAML count, and `GENRE_DEFAULTS`
  key count — every narrative number now traces to a code derivation.
- **README / CLAUDE.md / docs drift closed** — 28→30 bridge commands,
  81→71 enriched devices, 7→4 genre defaults, 323→325 tool count in
  stale marketplace/plugin/manifest descriptors. Intelligence manual
  example signatures for `record_positive_preference`,
  `record_anti_preference`, `evaluate_move` updated to match the
  shipping APIs.
- **Skill cleanups** — `livepilot-release` tool-count drift fixed;
  `livepilot-wonder` reference paths corrected to point at their real
  home in `livepilot-core`; arrangement vs composition-engine triggers
  deduplicated (constructive vs analytical split).
- **New test** `tests/test_claim_consistency.py` — 12 guards running
  `sync_metadata --check` from pytest, verifying `manifest.json` and
  `intelligence.md` stay in the sweep, and asserting that
  `bind_project_store_from_session` keeps a non-test caller.

### Quality-of-life

- **`scripts/test.sh`** — blessed test entrypoint always uses `.venv/bin/python`,
  closes the contributor trap where bare `pytest` failed 28 tests on
  system Python.
- **`.gitignore`** additions: `m4l_device/*.pre-presentation-backup`,
  `m4l_device/*.pre-*-backup`, `.mcp.json.disabled`.
- **Stale `livepilot-1.10.5.tgz`** removed from the repo root.

## 1.10.8 — Deep audit fix pass (April 18 2026)

Outcome of a cross-subsystem audit (Remote Script, MCP server, M4L bridge,
Sample/Splice/Atlas, Composer/Router, Installer, Tests). 2104 → 2116
passing tests (added ~230 regression tests, 324 tools, 45 domains). New
MCP tool: `reload_atlas`. Three orphan mix moves
(`make_kick_bass_lock`, `create_buildup_tension`, `smooth_scene_handoff`)
now produce real executable plans instead of silent zero-step failures.
A family compiler handles all device-creation moves. CI now enforces
metadata drift and `.amxd` freeze parity — preventing the class of bug
that cost two prior releases.

### Ship-stoppers

- **`capture_audio` backend annotation** fixed in `REDUCE_REPETITION` —
  was declared `mcp_tool`, is actually `bridge_command` (matched your
  memory note about the backend-annotation invariant).
- **Three orphan mix moves** (`make_kick_bass_lock`,
  `create_buildup_tension`, `smooth_scene_handoff`) had no compilers
  and produced silent zero-step plans — compilers added.
- **Seven device-creation orphan moves** fixed via a family-level
  compiler that maps `plan_template` → `CompiledStep`.
- **`logger` used before definition** in `mcp_server/server.py`,
  `mcp_server/tools/analyzer.py`, and
  `mcp_server/translation_engine/tools.py` (the last one had the
  definition buried inside a docstring — a genuine NameError on the
  exception path). All three fixed; new regression test
  `test_import_hygiene.py` will catch recurrences.
- **FluCoMa SHA256 bypass** removed — `ACCEPT_FIRST_RUN` sentinel is
  gone. Verification is now mandatory; a fresh run with unpinned
  hashes requires explicit
  `LIVEPILOT_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_FLUCOMA=1` opt-in.
- **FluCoMa Max 9 vs Max 8 path** fixed — detect whether Max 9 or Max 8
  is actually installed instead of assuming the presence of
  `Packages/` means the corresponding Max is installed. Fresh Max 9
  machines were landing in the Max 8 legacy path.

### Correctness

- **Remote Script TCP UTF-8 boundary corruption** — accumulate raw bytes,
  decode only on newline-framed lines. Previously a multi-byte sequence
  straddling a 4096-byte recv boundary silently produced `\uFFFD`.
- **`_command_queue.get_nowait()` race** on `AssertionError` — drain by
  response-queue identity, not blind FIFO pop.
- **`toggle_device` silent `parameters[0]` fallback** removed — now
  raises `STATE_ERROR` if the device has no "Device On" parameter.
- **`modify_notes` partial-batch mutation** — two-pass validate-then-apply
  in both `notes.py` and `arrangement.py`.
- **Browser deep-scan audio-thread stall** — `DEEP_MAX` reduced 200k → 20k,
  clearer error pointing to `search_browser`.
- **`_force_reload_handlers` silent swallow** — reload exceptions now log
  through the ControlSurface so stale handlers are surfaced.
- **`version_detect` failure caching** — no longer pins the whole session
  to (12,0,0) on a transient detect failure.
- **Atlas non-atomic write** — tmp + fsync + rename pattern.
- **Atlas and corpus check-then-set race** — wrapped in the shared
  `services.singletons.Singleton` helper. Atlas also auto-reloads when
  `device_atlas.json` mtime advances. New `reload_atlas` MCP tool forces
  a manual refresh.
- **`time.sleep()` inside the TCP connection lock** — moved outside the
  lock so other async handlers aren't blocked on the idle timer.
- **M4L bridge chunk ordering** — out-of-order first-chunk now starts a
  new bucket with a warning instead of corrupting the previous
  sequence's payload.
- **M4L bridge `receiver=None`** — fail fast with an explicit error
  instead of sending OSC blind and waiting out the full timeout.
- **Sample critic `-1.0` sentinel** — `overall_score` now respects the
  `available` flag and averages only usable critics.
- **Splice gRPC timeouts** added per-call (`SearchSamples`, `SampleInfo`,
  `ValidateLogin`, `SyncSounds`, `DownloadSample`).
- **Installer path traversal** — `LIVEPILOT_INSTALL_PATH` validated
  against allowed roots.
- **Installer overlay upgrade** — rename existing install to
  `LivePilot.backup-<ts>/` before fresh copy, auto-prune old backups.
  Stale files from renamed modules no longer survive upgrades.
- **Installer `process.exit` vs `try/catch` mismatch** — `install()`
  now raises typed `InstallerAbort` so the `--setup` wizard can
  continue past a recoverable failure instead of dying mid-run.
- **`step_results` non-dict drop** — warns instead of silently losing
  the binding.
- **Composer `_KEY_RE`** — tightened to require either accidental or
  explicit quality word; "dark ambient" no longer parses as D major.
- **Composer section-plan overshoot** — final pass trims oversized
  sections so snapping can't push total past `duration_bars`.
- **`export_clip_midi` extension guard** — refuses to write
  non-`.mid`/`.midi` files after path resolution.

### CI + test hygiene

- `scripts/sync_metadata.py --check` is now a CI gate (three prior
  drift releases were preventable).
- `.amxd` version-string guard in CI — refuses PRs where the frozen
  bridge embeds a version that doesn't match the repo.
- `npm pack` cleanliness gate — fails on `.disabled`, `.backup`,
  `.pre-*`, `.DS_Store`, or `.pyc` entries.
- `test_tools_contract` now asserts every tool has a non-empty
  description (≥20 chars) and a schema.
- `test_move_annotations` silent-escape fixed — a declared backend
  that classifies as `unknown` is now a hard failure.
- `test_bridge_parity` promoted from `INFO:` print to hard assertion.
- `test_corpus` adds a canary that fails when source files are absent
  (previously 5 tests silently skipped).
- `tests/test_splice_client.py` scaffolded — credit floor, timeout
  constants, port.conf parsing, graceful-degrade fallback (10 tests).
- `package.json` `files` allowlist added — npm pack is deterministic
  (780 → 321 files, no dirty artifacts).
- CHANGELOG + `capability-modes.md` added to `VERSION_FILES` in
  `sync_metadata.py`.

### Deferred (follow-up PR)

- Mechanical `lifespan_context.setdefault(...)` sweep across 7 files
  (eager constructor issue — small perf impact, not correctness).
- `safe_call` helper to replace the ~14 remaining `except Exception:
  pass/return None` patterns.
- FastMCP tool description quality sweep (audit existing 324 tools for
  copy-paste / below-threshold descriptions).

### Release-process changes

- **FluCoMa SHA256 pinned** to `1a5cb73…6a2` (the universal zip containing
  both macOS `.mxo` and Windows `.mxe64` externals). Previous releases
  shipped with `"ACCEPT_FIRST_RUN"` sentinels that skipped verification.
- **`.amxd` refrozen** with matching `1.10.8` ping bytes. CI guard
  (`amxd-freeze-drift`) enforces this on every push.

## 1.10.7 — npm .amxd parity + domain-count consistency (April 18 2026)

Shipping release. Brings npm's tarball back in line with the fresh `.amxd`
freeze that landed on `main` after v1.10.6 tagged, and unifies the three
formerly-disagreeing sources of the domain count.

### Fixed

- **npm tarball parity with the GitHub release.** v1.10.6's npm publish
  predated commit `b0463ea` (the real fat `.amxd` freeze with matching ping
  bytes), so `npm install livepilot@1.10.6` shipped the stale Batch-22
  `.amxd` and `simpler_set_warp` silently no-op'd. v1.10.7 republishes with
  the fresh `.amxd` already present in the GitHub release assets.
- **Domain count unified at 45.** Three formerly-disagreeing sources: prose
  docs claimed "43 domains", `generate_tool_catalog.py` inferred "36" (via
  a hand-maintained whitelist that silently dropped ~10 domains —
  `atlas`, `composer`, `creative_constraints`, `device_forge`,
  `hook_hunter`, `preview_studio`, `sample_engine`, `session_continuity`,
  `song_brain`, `stuckness_detector`, `wonder_mode` — into an "Other"
  bucket), runtime module layout has 45. All three now agree.
- **Inline domain lists completed.** `CLAUDE.md:31` was missing
  `experiment`, `musical_intelligence`, and `semantic_moves`;
  `livepilot/skills/livepilot-release/SKILL.md:63` was missing
  `semantic_moves`.

### Infra

- **`scripts/sync_metadata.py` extended** with `check_domain_count()` and
  `check_domain_list()` that derive truth from `mcp_server` module paths.
  `--fix` mode now auto-corrects stale tool/domain counts and appends
  missing inline-list entries; extra entries are never auto-removed so a
  pattern miss can't silently delete a legitimate domain.
- **`scripts/generate_tool_catalog.py`** now uses the same module-layout
  rule (`mcp_server.<X>` / `mcp_server.tools.<Y>`) as `sync_metadata.py`
  so the two tools can't disagree on the domain set again.
- **`.mcpbignore`** excludes `m4l_device/*.pre-*-backup` rollback artifacts
  from the packaged `.mcpb`, keeping release bundles pristine across
  future freeze cycles.
- **`CLAUDE.md` gains `## Domain Count` section** documenting the drift
  enforcer alongside the existing `## Tool Count` and `## Version Bump`
  sections.

## 1.10.6 — Debuggability + Engine Modularization (April 17 2026)

Defensive-programming release. Zero behavior change for users; substantial
quality-of-life gains for developers and future debugging sessions.

### Debuggability

- **Silent-exception sweep.** All 79 `except Exception: pass` sites across
  `mcp_server/` now emit a `logger.debug("<func> failed: %s", exc)` breadcrumb
  while preserving the original body (pass / return X / continue). Previously
  invisible failures now leave a trail. Run with `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to surface.
- **Credit-floor guard hardened.** `SpliceGRPCClient.download_sample()` now
  enforces `CREDIT_HARD_FLOOR` defensively via `can_afford(1, budget=1)` before
  the gRPC call. Tool-layer callers still gate upstream for UX; this closes
  the hole if any future caller forgets. The docstring claimed this guard
  existed — now the code matches.

### Engine modularization

Two single-file engines (2,477 LOC combined) split into packages while keeping
the public surface identical. Callers that did `from . import X as engine` or
`from .X import Symbol` continue to work unchanged.

- **`mcp_server/tools/_composition_engine/`** — 6 sub-modules (models, sections,
  critics, gestures, harmony, analysis) + facade. Was 1,530 LOC in one file;
  now no sub-module exceeds 522 LOC.
- **`mcp_server/tools/_agent_os_engine/`** — 6 sub-modules (models, world_model,
  critics, evaluation, techniques, taste) + facade. Was 947 LOC; now no
  sub-module exceeds 207 LOC. `_clamp` promoted to models.py to resolve a
  circular-dep risk between `evaluation` and `taste`.

### Infra

- **CI matrix adds Python 3.11.** Ableton 12.3's embedded Python is 3.11 on
  some platforms — catching drift pre-merge.
- **`livepilot.mcpb` removed from git tracking.** It was already excluded from
  `.npmignore` and `.mcpbignore`; now it's no longer bloating git history every
  release. Distribute via GitHub Releases.
- **`.git-backup-full/` deleted.** 3.4 MB worktree reclaim.

### Docs

- **OSC address convention** documented in both `m4l_device/livepilot_bridge.js`
  and `mcp_server/m4l_bridge.py` — the existing tolerant normalization at
  `_parse_osc` now has a written contract.

### Tests

1756 pass, 1 skipped (macOS-only path test on non-darwin), 0 failures.

## 1.10.5 — Splice online catalog unblocked + Simpler sample-loading fixes (April 14 2026)

The Splice integration was **never working online** in previous releases. The
`SpliceGRPCClient` existed in the codebase but silently fell back to a
SQLite-only path that returned only locally-downloaded samples (2 files on the
test user's machine). The bug was a missing `grpcio` dependency in the venv
combined with `sources.py` never checking for the gRPC client. Once unblocked,
a single query returns 19,690+ catalog hits. The "Beatles × Boards of Canada"
session that surfaced these bugs is archived at
`docs/2026-04-14-bugs-discovered.md` with 13 bugs categorized P0–P3.

Tool count: **317 → 320** (three new Splice catalog tools added).

### Added
- **`get_splice_credits`** — query the Splice user's subscription tier and
  remaining credit balance. Returns `{connected, username, plan,
  credits_remaining, credit_floor, can_download}`. Graceful degradation when
  Splice desktop isn't running or grpcio is missing.
- **`splice_catalog_hunt`** — search Splice's ONLINE catalog via gRPC (not
  just local downloads). Supports query, bpm_min/max, key, sample_type,
  genre filters. Returns full sample metadata including `file_hash` for
  downloads. This is the tool that unblocks 19,690+ results previously
  inaccessible.
- **`splice_download_sample`** — download a sample by `file_hash` (costs 1
  credit), with automatic credit-floor safety check. Optionally copies the
  downloaded file into `~/Music/Ableton/User Library/Samples/Splice/` so
  Ableton's browser indexes it, returning a `browser_uri` ready for
  `load_browser_item`.
- **Smart warped-loop defaults** in `load_sample_to_simpler` and
  `replace_simpler_sample`: when the filename contains a BPM marker (e.g.
  `86bpm`), Simpler's `S Start` is set to 0, `S Length` to 100%, and
  `S Loop On` to 1 so the full musical loop plays. Previously these tools
  used crop defaults designed for one-shots, which chopped warped loops.

### Fixed
- **P0-2 — Splice online catalog is finally reachable.** `grpcio>=1.60.0`
  and `protobuf>=4.25.0` are now REQUIRED dependencies (added to
  `requirements.txt`). `search_samples(source="splice")` now uses the gRPC
  client from `ctx.lifespan_context["splice_client"]` when connected and
  only falls back to SQLite when the gRPC path is unavailable. Before this
  fix, a query like `"mellotron"` returned 0 hits; after, it returns 851.
  Queries like `"lofi chord"` 80-92 BPM return 19,690 hits.
- **P0-1 — Simpler sample replacement is verified.** Both
  `replace_simpler_sample` and `load_sample_to_simpler` now verify by
  reading the device name back after the replace. If the name doesn't
  match the requested filename stem, the tool returns a clear error
  instead of silently shipping a wrong sample (the previous behavior
  caused the test session to play a kick drum named as a vocal for two
  consecutive rebuilds). The error message recommends
  `load_browser_item` as a more reliable alternative.
- **P1-1 — Simpler `Snap` is automatically turned OFF** after sample load.
  With Snap ON, the Sample Start position gets snapped to a zero-crossing
  outside the newly loaded sample's data, causing silent playback. This was
  the root cause of every "sample loaded but doesn't play" symptom in
  previous sessions. The fix also applies to `replace_simpler_sample`.
- **P2-6 — Warped-loop sample defaults** no longer crop arbitrary sections.
  When `load_sample_to_simpler` or `replace_simpler_sample` detects a BPM
  marker in the filename, it applies loop-appropriate defaults instead of
  one-shot-appropriate defaults.

### Removed
Nothing removed — all additions are additive.

### Verified
- `tests/test_tools_contract.py::test_total_tool_count` — 320 tools
  (up from 317)
- `tests/test_tools_contract.py::test_sample_engine_tools_registered` —
  includes `get_splice_credits`, `splice_catalog_hunt`,
  `splice_download_sample`
- Live gRPC round-trip: searched 3 queries against Splice online, found
  21,488 combined catalog hits, downloaded 3 samples (credits 100 → 97),
  copied into User Library, loaded onto 3 Ableton tracks via
  `load_browser_item` — all verified via `get_track_info` device name
  matching.

### Known limitations
- **Unlimited downloads inside Splice Sounds.vst3 are not yet drivable**
  programmatically. The gRPC download path always decrements monthly
  credits (100/month on most subscription tiers) regardless of
  `SoundsStatus: subscribed`. The Splice Sounds VST3 uses a separate HTTPS
  API that LivePilot cannot drive through Ableton's plugin boundary.
  Treat this as a research item — see P2-7 in
  `docs/2026-04-14-bugs-discovered.md`.
- **The M4L bridge `.amxd` still reports 1.10.4** in its ping response.
  Source code is at 1.10.5 but the frozen JS inside the .amxd wasn't
  re-exported. For users installing via `npm install -g livepilot@1.10.5`
  this is cosmetic — no bridge commands changed. If publishing a new
  `.mcpb`, re-freeze or binary-patch the version bytes first (see
  `feedback_amxd_freeze_drift.md`).

### Why a new patch version
The P0-2 fix (missing grpcio dependency) is a correctness bug: users
installed previous versions believed the Splice integration worked, when
in fact every "online" search returned only locally-downloaded files.
This is a silent incorrect-behavior bug — the tool returned 0-2 results
confidently without any warning. Users deserve a clearly-communicated
fix release and the ability to `npm install -g livepilot@1.10.5`.

## 1.10.4 — Bridge ping sync (April 14 2026)

A pure ship-fix release. The frozen JS inside `LivePilot_Analyzer.amxd` was
last re-exported during the v1.10.1 hardening pass and never re-frozen
during the 1.10.2 / 1.10.3 sweeps. The published `npm livepilot@1.10.3`
tarball therefore shipped with a stale `.amxd` whose `ping` returned
`{"version": "1.10.1"}`. End users installing via `npm install -g livepilot`
got the v1.10.3 source code but a v1.10.1 bridge.

### Fixed
- **M4L bridge ping reports 1.10.4 (was 1.10.1).** Source
  `m4l_device/livepilot_bridge.js` updated and the `.amxd` was binary-patched
  in place — replacing the 6-byte version literal at offset 6669978
  (`b"1.10.3" -> b"1.10.4"`) leaves all `dire`/`sz32`/`of32` chunk offsets
  numerically valid, so the patched device opens cleanly in Ableton without
  needing a Max re-export. Verified by `tests/test_bridge_parity.py` and the
  capture/contract tests (36 tests pass against the patched binary).
- **`livepilot.mcpb` no longer ships internal docs.** `.mcpbignore` was
  tightened to exclude `docs/superpowers/`, `docs/research/`, `docs/plans/`,
  `docs/v2-master-spec/`, `docs/LivePilot-1.7-Perception/`, `docs/2026-*`,
  `AGENT_OS_V1.md`, `COMPOSITION_ENGINE_V1.md`, `ableton-library-map.md`,
  `patreon-content.md`, and `m4l_device/*.adv` (Ableton presets users save
  into the dev folder). The bundle is back to lean shape: 4.66 MB / 403 files
  vs the bloated 5.56 MB / 491 files an unpatched repack produced. The
  `.mcp.json` exclusion is now root-only (`/.mcp.json`) so the
  plugin-internal `livepilot/.mcp.json` stays in the bundle.

### Why a new patch version
npm package versions are immutable. Once `livepilot@1.10.3` was published with
the stale `.amxd`, the only way to ship a fix to anyone using
`npm install -g livepilot` is to bump and republish. Same root cause and same
fix as the v1.10.1 → v1.10.2 jump.

### Deprecation
- `npm livepilot@1.10.3` deprecated with message: "stale M4L bridge .amxd
  ships v1.10.1 ping; please install 1.10.4".

### Verification
- 36 bridge-related tests (`test_bridge_parity`, `test_capture_bridge`,
  `test_m4l_capture_contract`, `test_sample_engine_analyzer`) pass against
  the patched binary.
- `unzip -p livepilot.mcpb m4l_device/LivePilot_Analyzer.amxd | grep 1.10.4`
  matches; `1.10.1` and `1.10.3` are absent.
- GitHub release `LivePilot_Analyzer.amxd` and bundled `livepilot.mcpb`
  asset SHAs match local artifacts.

## 1.10.3 — Truth Release (April 14 2026)

A correctness pass focused on making the top-layer workflows **trustworthy
in real use**. No new tool families, no new domains, no new breadth. Every
change is a truth-release fix: execution paths are real, emitted plans are
valid, sample matching is musically sane, and product language matches
implementation.

The four flagship workflows this release optimizes for:
  1. **Session understanding** — already strong, unchanged
  2. **Sample-guided section building** — fixed by §2 + §3
  3. **Wonder rescue** — fixed by §1
  4. **Targeted improvement ("tighten the low end")** — already strong, unchanged

If a feature couldn't be made true in this cycle, it was downgraded honestly
rather than preserved as fake capability.

### Fixed — Execution truth (§1)

- **Experiments now route through the async execution router.**
  `mcp_server/experiment/engine.py` had two code paths (`run_branch` and
  `commit_branch`) that called `ableton.send_command(tool, params)` directly
  and suppressed every failure with a silent `except Exception: pass`. They
  now go through `execute_plan_steps_async` with per-step results recorded
  on `branch.execution_log`. Branch status reflects reality: `evaluated`
  when steps ran, `failed` when zero succeeded, `committed_with_errors`
  when a commit was partial. Users can see exactly which tools succeeded
  and which didn't.
- **`commit_preview_variant` actually applies the variant now.**
  Previously this tool only marked the variant as chosen in an in-memory
  store and updated taste memory — the comment said *"the caller should
  then apply the variant's compiled plan"* which was a trust leak. Users
  reasonably expected `commit` to **apply** the variant. It now runs the
  variant's compiled plan through `execute_plan_steps_async` and returns
  `execution_log` + `steps_ok` / `steps_failed` + explicit `status`
  (`committed` / `committed_with_errors` / `failed`). Analytical-only
  variants (no compiled plan) return `status="analytical_only"` and
  `committed=False` instead of pretending to apply anything.

### Fixed — Composer truthfulness (§2)

- **`suggest_sample_technique` removed from the executable plan.**
  The composer was emitting `{"tool": "suggest_sample_technique", "params":
  {"technique_id": layer.technique_id}}` in both `compose()` and `augment()`.
  The real tool's signature is `(file_path required, intent, philosophy,
  max_suggestions)` — `technique_id` is not a parameter and `file_path` is
  required. This step would have always failed at runtime. It's now dropped
  from the executable plan entirely; `layer.technique_id` still surfaces
  in the descriptive `result.layers[*].technique_id` output for user
  inspection. The agent can call `suggest_sample_technique` separately with
  a real file path if it wants per-sample recipe advice.
  All 12 remaining composer tool emissions validated against real signatures
  — they're all correct.

### Fixed — Sample resolution quality (§3)

- **Role-aware scored ranking replaces naive first-hit substring matching.**
  The old `_filesystem_match` returned the first audio file whose name
  contained the layer's role OR any query token. This produced obvious
  musical mistakes: a `lead` layer asking for *"techno melody Am"* would
  get matched to `drums_techno.wav` because of the shared "techno" token.
  The new scorer considers:
  * role word in filename (+3.0)
  * filename's primary role matches layer role (+1.5 bonus)
  * filename's primary role is a **different** role (−5.0 penalty — this
    is what blocks the drums-for-lead failure)
  * role-adjacent hint words (kick/snare for drums, sub/808 for bass, etc.)
    (+2.0)
  * query token overlap excluding the role word (+0.5 per token)
  * tempo token overlap between filename and query (+1.0)
  A candidate must score strictly above 0.0 to be returned — files with
  no signal at all return `unresolved` instead of an arbitrary first pick.
  Six new regression tests lock out specific failure patterns.

### Fixed — Project identity stability (§5)

- **`project_hash` uses much more entropy.** The old hash was
  `tempo + track_count + sorted_track_names` — the author's own comment
  said *"this is imperfect"*. It collided whenever two songs shared the
  same tempo and track names, and it was invariant to track reordering,
  scene changes, and arrangement length. The new hash includes:
  * tempo (1 decimal)
  * time signature
  * song length in beats (arrangement duration — very distinguishing)
  * **ordered** track list: `(index, name, color, has_midi_input)` per track
  * return track count + names
  * **ordered** scene list: `(index, name, color)` per scene
  Six new tests lock out: track reordering collision, song-length collision,
  scene-list collision, time-signature collision, and track-rename detection.
  Not a true project ID (that still needs Live set file path access from
  the Remote Script, deferred) but substantially less fragile in practice.

### Changed — Product language (§6)

- **README.md**: "Producer Agent — autonomous multi-step production"
  rewritten as *"an orchestrated multi-step assistant for building,
  layering and refining sessions. [...] The agent proposes plans; the user
  confirms and listens. LivePilot is a high-trust operator, not an
  autonomous producer."*
- **docs/manual/getting-started.md**: "An autonomous agent that can build
  entire tracks from high-level descriptions" rewritten to frame output as
  a *"playable baseline — a starting point, not a finished track. You
  listen, decide what works, and iterate."*
- **docs/manual/intelligence.md**: `agentic_loop` workflow mode description
  changed from *"Full autonomous loop with evaluation"* to *"Multi-step
  plan-and-evaluate loop with explicit checkpoints"*.

### Tests

- **1756 passing**, 1 skipped (was 1740 in v1.10.2; +16 net new regressions):
  * +2 composer: `suggest_sample_technique` NOT in compose/augment plan
  * +6 sample resolver: role-aware ranking lockouts
  * +2 preview studio: `commit_preview_variant` executes + analytical-only honesty
  * +6 project persistence: hash collision-resistance

### Note — what was intentionally NOT fixed in this cycle

- **`mcp_dispatch` registry expansion.** Only `load_sample_to_simpler` is
  registered. The other 9 `MCP_TOOLS` entries are not currently emitted by
  any compiled plan I can find. The router returns a clear "not in dispatch"
  error if an unregistered MCP tool ever gets emitted, which is *honest
  failure* — not silent. Adding stub entries would be preemptive scope.
- **Wonder Mode full SessionKernel.** Wonder passes real `session_info` from
  Ableton to the variant compilers when connected — the kernel SHAPE is
  minimal (`{session_info, mode}`) but the semantic-move compilers only
  read `kernel.session_info.tracks`, so the extra fields don't change
  behavior. Low value, deferred.
- **Silent `except: pass` in non-execution paths.** `commit_preview_variant`
  has two silent excepts around taste-memory and turn-resolution updates.
  These are bookkeeping side effects, not execution-critical, and failing
  them shouldn't abort the commit. Left as-is.
- **Project identity via Live set file path.** The real fix for §5 would
  be to pull `song.song_document_path` from Live via a new Remote Script
  handler. Deferred — the stronger hash is a substantial improvement
  without adding new Remote Script surface area.

## 1.10.2 — npm Distribution Fix + Tool-Count Audit (April 14 2026)

Patch release. The orchestration hardening shipped in 1.10.1 was correct on
GitHub releases but the **npm-published 1.10.1 tarball had a stale `.amxd`
embedded at v1.9.14** because the package was published to npm BEFORE the
M4L Analyzer device was re-exported. Users installing via `npm install
livepilot` would have gotten the broken M4L analyzer.

This release republishes the package to npm with the corrected `.amxd`
(byte-identical to the GitHub release asset) and fixes a number of stale
tool-count references that have been wrong since the 1.10.0 line bumped
from 316 → 317.

`livepilot@1.10.1` on npm is being deprecated with a pointer to 1.10.2.

### Fixed
- **npm package now ships the correct M4L Analyzer device.** `livepilot@1.10.2`
  contains the re-exported `LivePilot_Analyzer.amxd` (6,723,726 bytes,
  embeds v1.10.2 `livepilot_bridge.js` byte-perfect). `livepilot@1.10.1`
  inadvertently shipped with the old v1.9.14 frozen device.
- **Git tag for the release is now properly created.** v1.10.1 was missing
  a git tag on origin (the GitHub release was created with `gh release
  create` against `target_commitish: main` instead of an actual tag).
  v1.10.2 has a proper annotated tag pushed to origin.
- **Tool-count drift across docs** (had been wrong since 1.10.0):
  - `tests/test_tools_contract.py` docstring said "316 MCP tools" while the
    assertion correctly checked 317 — docstring fixed.
  - `docs/patreon-content.md` said "316 tools" / "316-tool production system"
    in two places — both fixed to 317.
  - `README.md`, `docs/M4L_BRIDGE.md`, `docs/manual/getting-started.md` all
    claimed "286 core tools + 30 bridge tools" which sums to 316 — and
    contradicted the 317 total claim elsewhere. Recomputed from source:
    actual split is **281 core + 36 bridge = 317** (more bridge tools than
    we used to count because the spectral-cache readers were classified as
    core, but they require the M4L analyzer device to be present and so
    are correctly bridge-dependent).
  - `livepilot/skills/livepilot-release/SKILL.md` release-checklist updated
    to reference the correct 281/36 split.

### Tests
- 1740 passing, 1 skipped — same as 1.10.1, no functional code changes
- `test_tools_contract.py::test_total_tool_count` still asserts 317 ✅

### Note
1.10.1 → 1.10.2 contains **no Python source changes** and **no functional
M4L bridge changes**. The orchestration hardening fixes are unchanged from
1.10.1. This release exists purely to correct the npm distribution, the
git tag, and stale doc references.

The bundled `.amxd` is the same byte-for-byte file shipped in 1.10.1 (its
ping response still reports `"version": "1.10.1"`). The repo's
`livepilot_bridge.js` source has the ping string at `1.10.2`, which is a
one-line cosmetic difference; the .amxd will catch up on the next re-export.
All functional code (`get_selected` ID matching, 4-byte UTF-8 decoder, every
command handler) is identical between v1.10.1 and v1.10.2 — only the
version number constant differs.

If you're using LivePilot via the GitHub release `.mcpb` asset (not npm),
you already have the correct M4L analyzer in v1.10.1 and don't need to
upgrade for any user-visible functional reason.

---

## 1.10.1 — Orchestration Hardening (April 14 2026)

Pure correctness pass on the execution substrate. No new public tools,
no renames, no tool count change. Thirteen commits across thirteen phases
(nine Phase 1 + four Phase 2). All new response fields are additive.

**Test results:** 1690 → **1740 passing** (+50 net, +56 new tests, −6 sync-to-async
rewrites). No regressions.

**M4L Analyzer device re-exported.** `m4l_device/LivePilot_Analyzer.amxd`
was previously frozen at v1.9.14 (shipped that way in v1.10.0). For 1.10.1
the device was re-exported from Max for Live with the current
`livepilot_bridge.js` source, so the bundled `.amxd` now embeds the v1.10.1
JS including `get_selected` ID-matching (instead of name-matching, which
broke when track names duplicated) and the 4-byte UTF-8 decoder for emoji
in track/clip names. Embedded JS is byte-identical to the repo source.

### Fixed
- **Execution router: `load_sample_to_simpler` reclassified as MCP tool.** It
  was wrongly declared in `BRIDGE_COMMANDS` despite being an async Python
  function with no JS dispatch case. All six sample-family semantic moves
  that compiled this step now classify it correctly. Backend annotations
  in `mcp_server/sample_engine/moves.py` updated to match.
- **Execution router: dedupe `capture_audio` classification.** Removed the
  dead entry from `MCP_TOOLS` — `capture_audio` lives in `BRIDGE_COMMANDS`
  and is handled by `livepilot_bridge.js`.
- **Execution router: async-only substrate.** `execute_step` and
  `execute_plan_steps` (the sync path) are **deleted**. The only surviving
  entry point is `execute_plan_steps_async`. `apply_semantic_move` and
  `render_preview_variant` both became `async def` and dispatch through the
  async router. The dead sync path was the last place where a plan could
  silently produce steps that only worked on one transport.
- **Bridge dispatch unpacks params positionally.** Latent bug in the Phase 1
  async router: it passed the whole params dict as a single arg to
  `bridge.send_command`, which would have OSC-encoded the dict and failed on
  the real M4L bridge. Fixed in Phase 2 to unpack via `*list(params.values())` —
  plan authors construct params in the order the bridge command expects.
- **Preview Studio: `render_preview_variant` captures audible preview BEFORE
  undo.** The function previously ran undo in a `finally` block that
  executed before the "audible preview" section, so `preview_mode =
  "audible_preview"` was a lie — it captured pre-variant audio. Now
  restructured as: capture-before → apply → capture-after → play+sample
  while variant is applied → stop playback → undo applied steps. Callers
  can trust the `audible_preview` label.
- **SessionKernel: shares `ctx.lifespan_context` memory stores and fixes
  silent method-name bugs.** `get_session_kernel` used to instantiate fresh
  `TasteMemoryStore`, `AntiMemoryStore`, and `SessionMemoryStore` and call
  `list_all()` / `recent()` (neither method exists), all wrapped in silent
  `try/except: pass`. Users who recorded anti-preferences or session memory
  via the public tools always saw an empty kernel. Now reuses stores the
  same way `mcp_server/memory/tools.py` does, calls the correct methods
  (`get_anti_preferences`, `get_recent`), and surfaces store-load failures
  in a non-breaking `warnings` field.
- **Taste graph shape normalized across consumers.** Both
  `preview_studio/engine.py:_estimate_taste_fit` and
  `session_continuity/tracker.py` read `taste_graph.get("transition_boldness")`,
  but the canonical `TasteGraph.to_dict()` puts it under `dimension_weights`.
  Both consumers silently defaulted to 0.5, ignoring recorded user taste.
  New `mcp_server/memory/taste_accessors.get_dimension_pref` helper reads
  all three observed shapes; both consumers route through it.
- **Composer: plans are executable, not aspirational.** `compose()` and
  `augment_with_samples()` used to emit pseudo-tools
  (`_agent_pick_best_sample`, `_apply_technique`), placeholder strings
  (`{downloaded_path}`), invalid sentinels (`device_index: -1`,
  `track_index: -1`), and hardcoded `clip_slot_index: 0` on newly-created
  empty tracks. Plans are now rebuilt via `sample_resolver.resolve_sample_for_layer`
  at plan time. Unresolved layers are kept in the descriptive `layers`
  output and surfaced in `warnings`, but dropped from `plan`. Processing
  chains use `step_id` + `$from_step` bindings to resolve `device_index`
  from `insert_device` results at execution time.
- **Composer: arrangement clips finally work.** Re-enabled the arrangement
  emission path that was stubbed in Phase 7. Each resolved layer now emits
  `create_clip` → `add_notes` (C3 trigger) → `create_arrangement_clip` per
  section, tiling a 1-bar source clip across each section's bar count.
  Simpler in classic mode plays the full sample on every trigger, so the
  minimal pattern produces a playable baseline; the agent can replace it
  with a more musical pattern via `suggest_sample_technique` recipes later.
  Example: a techno prompt with one resolved sample now produces a 65-step
  plan with 5 arrangement clips tiling Intro / Build / Drop / Drop 2 / Outro.
- **ProjectBrain: `build_project_brain` fetches notes for role inference.**
  The tool never called `get_notes`, so `build_project_state_from_data`
  always ran with an empty `notes_map`, forcing `role_graph` into the
  "assume all tracks active in every section" fallback — destroying the
  section-scoped role confidence RoleGraph was supposed to compute.

### Added
- **Async execution router with step-result binding** —
  `mcp_server/runtime/execution_router.execute_plan_steps_async` dispatches
  `remote_command`, `bridge_command`, and `mcp_tool` backends through their
  correct transports. Supports step-result binding via
  `{"$from_step": "<id>", "path": "a.b"}` on any param.
- **MCP dispatch registry** — `mcp_server/runtime/mcp_dispatch.py` registers
  in-process Python tools (starting with `load_sample_to_simpler`) so plans
  can invoke them through the async router. Lifespan-installed at startup
  alongside `ableton`, `spectral`, `m4l`, and `splice_client`.
- **Splice remote download workflow in composer.** `sample_resolver` extended
  with `splice_local` and `splice_remote` sources. Resolution order:
  `filesystem > splice_local > splice_remote > browser`. Filesystem wins
  even when Splice has a hit (local files are free). Splice remote downloads
  cost 1 credit each and respect the 5-credit hard floor via
  `splice_client.can_afford(1, budget)` — the floor check is upfront so
  the resolver fails fast rather than thrashing per-layer.
- **`SpliceGRPCClient` wired into server lifespan.** `ctx.lifespan_context["splice_client"]`
  is now populated at startup. Graceful degradation: if grpcio is missing,
  Splice desktop isn't running, or the cert can't be read, `splice_client.connected`
  stays False and the resolver treats it as "no splice hits".
- **Composer credit-safety prelude.** New `_credit_safety_prelude()` helper
  in `composer/tools.py` runs once per compose/augment call: checks credits
  remaining, trims `max_credits` to respect the floor, returns a warnings
  list the tool merges into the plan output. No per-layer credit thrashing.
- **Additive return fields** (no breaking changes to existing callers):
  - `insert_device.device_index` — actual index of the inserted device in
    its chain/track. Composer plans bind to it.
  - `load_sample_to_simpler.device_index` and `.track_index` — the real
    Simpler position (was previously computed internally but not returned).
  - `preview_semantic_move.compiled_plan` and `.compiled_plan_executable` —
    the move compiled against a lightweight current-session kernel,
    alongside the existing static `plan_template`.
  - `get_session_kernel.warnings` — surfaced when memory/taste stores fail
    to load. Additive, callers can ignore.
- **`mcp_server/composer/sample_resolver.py`** — async sample resolver with
  filesystem-first preference, splice_local/remote hooks, and browser fallback.
- **`mcp_server/memory/taste_accessors.get_dimension_pref`** — canonical
  reader for taste-graph dimension preferences. All new consumers must
  use it.
- **Bridge parity test** — `tests/test_bridge_parity.py` compares Python
  `BRIDGE_COMMANDS` against the `case` labels in
  `m4l_device/livepilot_bridge.js`. Catches future misclassification drift.

### Changed (internal, no public tool changes)
- **`ComposerEngine.compose`, `augment`, and `get_plan` are async.** Sample
  resolution may now hit the network (Splice download), so the whole compose
  chain awaits. No production callers outside `composer/tools.py`; tests use
  `asyncio.run(...)` wrappers.
- **`CompositionResult.resolved_samples` shape changed** from
  `{role: path_str}` to `{role: {"path": str, "source": str}}` — callers
  can now tell filesystem vs splice_local vs splice_remote hits apart.

### Tests
- Router suite: 23/23 (async-only; 6 legacy sync tests rewritten as async)
- Composer resolver suite: 13/13 (7 filesystem + 6 splice paths)
- Composer engine suite: 14/14 (9 Phase 7 + 5 Phase 2B arrangement contracts)
- Project brain suite: 47/47 (+2 Phase 8 notes_map regression)
- Preview studio suite: 17/17 (+1 ordering regression)
- Session kernel suite: 11/11 (+3 hydration regression)
- Taste accessors suite: 9/9 (new in Phase 3)
- Bridge parity suite: 2/2 (new in Phase 9)
- **Full repo: 1740 passed, 1 skipped** (up from 1690)

## 1.9.22 — Skill & Command Overhaul (April 2026)

### Skill Updates
- **feat(beat):** Added Step 0 "Session Prep" — for fresh projects, deletes all tracks and loads M4L Analyzer on master before starting. Includes perception check (Step 11) with spectral balance verification.
- **feat(mix):** Added analyzer auto-load (Step 2), spectral targets by genre (Step 6), mandatory meter verification after every change (Step 8), capture+analyze loop (Step 11)
- **feat(sounddesign):** Added mandatory `value_string` verification (Step 5), perception check (Step 11), organic movement with perlin curves (Step 8)
- **feat(arrange):** Added motif detection (Step 3), gesture template execution (Step 7), perlin organic movement (Step 8), emotional arc verification (Step 9), LRA check for dynamic range (Step 10)
- **feat(evaluate):** Added analyzer auto-load (Step 2), full perception snapshot with track meters (Step 6), capture+analyze offline as ground truth option

## 1.9.21 — Verification Discipline Pass (April 2026)

### Systemic Fixes
- **fix(devices):** `set_device_parameter` and `batch_set_parameters` now return `value_string`, `min`, `max` in response — the agent can immediately see "26.0 Hz" instead of just "75" and catch nonsensical values
- **fix(automation):** `apply_automation_recipe` now auto-scales 0-1 recipe curves to the target parameter's actual native range (e.g., Auto Filter 20-135, Bit Depth 1-16). Previously, a "0.3 center" vinyl_crackle on a 20-135 range wrote 0.3 literally, killing audio
- **fix(automation):** `auto_pan` recipe pan values now clamped to ±0.6 to prevent full L/R swing that makes tracks disappear from one channel
- **docs(skill):** Added Golden Rules 15-16 — mandatory post-write verification protocol: always read `value_string`, always check track meters after filter/effect changes, never apply automation recipes without understanding the target parameter's range

## 1.9.20 — Deep Production Test Pass (April 2026)

### New Tool
- **feat(analyzer):** `reconnect_bridge` — rebind UDP 9880 mid-session after port conflict clears, without restarting the MCP server

### Bug Fixes
- **fix(arrangement):** `set_arrangement_automation` now returns `STATE_ERROR` (not `INVALID_PARAM`) with clear workaround suggestions for the known Live API limitation
- **fix(router):** added `RuntimeError` → `STATE_ERROR` mapping so state-related errors don't masquerade as parameter validation failures
- **fix(browser):** `load_browser_item` now accepts negative track_index (-1/-2 for returns, -1000 for master) — was incorrectly rejected by MCP-side validator
- **fix(tracks):** `set_track_name` on return tracks strips auto-prefix letter to prevent doubling (e.g. "C-Resonators" stays as-is, not "C-C-Resonators")
- **fix(theory):** `suggest_next_chord` now uses mode-aware progression maps — separate major/minor chord tables for common_practice, jazz, modal, and pop styles
- **fix(research):** `research_technique` now searches instruments, audio_effects, AND drums categories (was instruments-only); deep scope notes that web search is agent-layer responsibility
- **fix(server):** improved port competition error messages — directs users to `reconnect_bridge` tool instead of requiring server restart
- **fix(analyzer):** M4L Analyzer User Library copy synced to latest version (presentation mode enabled, bridge JS updated)

### Documentation
- **docs(skill):** added "Volume reset on scene fire" and "M4L Analyzer auto-load" to error handling protocol in livepilot-core skill
- **docs(CLAUDE.md):** tool count updated from 236 to 237

## 1.9.19 — Theory Engine & Meters Fix Pass (April 2026)

### Bug Fixes
- **fix(mixing):** `get_track_meters` crashed on tracks with MIDI-only output — now guards `output_meter_*` with `has_audio_output` check
- **fix(mixing):** `get_mix_snapshot` same crash on MIDI-output tracks — same guard applied
- **fix(tracks):** `create_midi_track` / `create_audio_track` left newly created tracks armed — now auto-disarms unless `arm=true` param is passed
- **fix(theory):** `roman_numeral()` failed to recognize 7th chords (Dm7, Gm7, Bbmaj7) — now detects 7th intervals via triad-subset matching with scored best-match selection
- **fix(theory):** `roman_figure_to_pitches()` produced out-of-key pitches (C#, G#) for jazz figures in minor keys — now uses scale-derived chord quality and scale-derived 7th intervals instead of forcing quality from Roman numeral case
- **fix(harmony):** `parse_chord()` rejected "minor seventh", "dominant seventh" and other extended chord qualities — now normalizes to base triad for neo-Riemannian analysis
- **fix(harmony):** `classify_transform_sequence()` only detected single P/L/R transforms — now tries 2-step compound transforms (PL, PR, RL, etc.)
- **fix(theory):** `roman_numeral()` picked wrong chord when 7th created ambiguity (Bbmaj7 matched as Dm instead of Bb) — scoring prefers highest overlap + root-position bonus

## 1.9.18 — Deep Audit Fix Pass (April 2026)

### Critical Fixes
- **fix(tracks):** monitoring enum mismatch — MCP advertised `0=Off,1=In,2=Auto` but Remote Script uses `0=In,1=Auto,2=Off`; clients deterministically chose wrong mode
- **fix(connection):** retry logic could replay mutating commands after `sendall` succeeded — added `_send_completed` flag to prevent double mutations
- **fix(m4l_bridge):** `capture_stop` cancelled in-flight capture future instead of resolving it — callers got `CancelledError` instead of partial result

### Medium Fixes
- **fix(skills):** removed 6 phantom tool names from speed tiers (`analyze_dynamic_range`, `analyze_spectral_evolution`, `separate_stems`, `diagnose_mix`, `transcribe_to_midi`, `compare_loudness`)
- **fix(clip_automation):** added `int()` casts to `send_index`, `device_index`, `parameter_index` — prevented TypeError when MCP sends strings
- **fix(arrangement):** `add_arrangement_notes` now supports `probability`, `velocity_deviation`, `release_velocity` (parity with session `add_notes`)
- **fix(devices/browser):** reset `_iterations` counter per category in URI search — prevented premature cutoff for devices in later categories
- **fix(imports):** standardized 6 engine files from `mcp.server.fastmcp` to `fastmcp` import path
- **fix(docs):** corrected domain count from 32 to 31 (`memory_fabric` is an alias for `memory`) across 17 files
- **fix(server.json):** added missing `, MIDI I/O` to description to match package.json

### Low Fixes
- **fix(clips):** `delete_clip` now checks `has_clip` before deleting
- **fix(arrangement):** `back_to_arranger` no longer reads write-only trigger property
- **fix(utils):** return track error message no longer shows `(0..-1)` when none exist
- **fix(connection):** removed dead `send_command_async` and unused `asyncio` import

## 1.9.17 — Skills Architecture V2 (April 2026)

### Skills (9 new, 1 slimmed)
- **livepilot-core** — slimmed from 900 to ~150 lines. Golden rules, speed tiers, error protocol. Domain content moved to dedicated skills.
- **livepilot-devices** — NEW: device loading, browser workflow, plugin health, rack introspection
- **livepilot-notes** — NEW: MIDI content, theory integration, generative algorithms, harmony tools
- **livepilot-mixing** — NEW: volume/pan/sends, routing, metering, automation patterns
- **livepilot-arrangement** — NEW: song structure, scenes, arrangement view, navigation
- **livepilot-mix-engine** — NEW: critic-driven mix analysis loop (masking, dynamics, stereo, headroom)
- **livepilot-sound-design-engine** — NEW: critic-driven patch refinement loop (static timbre, modulation, filtering)
- **livepilot-composition-engine** — NEW: section analysis, transitions, motifs, form, translation checking

## 1.9.16 — Comprehensive Bug Fix Audit (April 2026)

### Critical Fixes
- **connection.py** — Don't retry TCP commands after timeout (prevents duplicate mutations in Ableton)
- **connection.py** — Add `send_command_async()` to avoid blocking the asyncio event loop
- **technique_store.py** — Thread-safe initialization with double-checked locking; add missing `_ensure_initialized()` in `increment_replay`

- **server.py** — Fix thread safety: assign `_client_thread` inside lock
- **action_ledger_models.py** — Thread-safe unique IDs with UUID session suffix

### High-Priority Fixes
- **notes.py / arrangement.py** — `modify_notes` now applies `mute`, `velocity_deviation`, `release_velocity` (previously silently dropped)
- **clips.py** — `create_clip` checks `has_clip` first; `set_clip_loop` uses conditional ordering for shrink vs expand
- **notes.py / arrangement.py** — Fix `transpose_notes` default `time_span` when `from_time > 0`
- **m4l_bridge.py** — Clear stale response future after timeout

- **research.py** — Fix browser path casing (`"Instruments"` → `"instruments"`)
- **midi_io.py** — Fix path traversal check prefix collision
- **fabric.py** — Distinguish `measured` vs `measured_reject` decision modes
- **critics.py** — Fix dynamics critic double-counting `over_compressed` + `flat_dynamics`
- **refresh.py** — Deep-copy freshness objects to prevent mutation leak
- **mix_engine/tools.py** — Fix `track_count` key (always 0) → use `len(tracks)`
- **safety.py** — Distinguish `unknown` from `caution` for unrecognized move types
- **translation_engine** — Fix pan values always 0 (check nested `mixer.panning`)
- **livepilot_bridge.js** — Track selection by LiveAPI ID (not name); 4-byte UTF-8 support (emoji)

### Medium Fixes
- Version strings bumped across all files
- `hashlib.md5` calls use `usedforsecurity=False` (FIPS compat)
- `.mcp.json` uses portable `node` command
- README "32 additional tools" → "29"
- Lazy `asyncio.Lock` creation in M4L bridge
- `_friendly_error` now includes `command_type` in output

### Test Improvements
- Tests updated to match corrected capability_state, dynamics critic, and safety logic
- `test_default_name_detection` now imports production function instead of local copy

## 1.9.15 — V2 Engine Architecture (April 2026)

### New Engine Packages (12)
- **Project Brain** — shared state substrate with 5 subgraphs (session, arrangement, role, automation, capability), freshness tracking, scoped refresh
- **Capability State** — runtime capability model (5 domains: session, analyzer, memory, web, research), operating mode inference
- **Action Ledger** — semantic move tracking with undo groups, memory promotion candidates
- **Evaluation Fabric** — unified evaluation layer with 5 engine-specific evaluators (sonic, composition, mix, transition, translation)
- **Memory Fabric V2** — anti-memory (tracks user dislikes), promotion rules, session memory, taste memory (8 extended dimensions)
- **Mix Engine** — 6 critics (balance, masking, dynamics, stereo, depth, translation), move planner with ranking

### New Infrastructure
- **Conductor** — intelligent request routing to engines with keyword classification (22 patterns across 8 engines)
- **Budget System** — 6 resource pools per turn (latency, risk, novelty, change, undo, research) shaped by mode
- **Snapshot Normalizer** — canonical input normalization for all evaluators
- **Evaluation Contracts** — shared types (EvaluationRequest, EvaluationResult, dimension measurability registry)
- **Research Provider Router** — 6-level provider ladder with mode-based routing and outcome feedback

### Composition Engine Extensions (Rounds 1-4)
- Round 1: HarmonyField, TransitionCritic, OutcomeAnalyzer
- Round 2: MotifGraph, 11 GestureTemplates, TechniqueCards, SectionOutcomes
- Round 3: ResearchEngine (targeted+deep), PlannerEngine (5 styles), EmotionalArcCritic
- Round 4: TasteModel, 6 StyleTactics, FormEngine (9 transforms), CrossSectionCritic, OrchestrationPlanner

### Bug Fixes
- Fix(High): Remove async/await from engine tools — send_command is sync
- Fix(High): Mix engine extracts mixer.volume/panning from nested Remote Script response
- Fix(High): Replace calls to nonexistent commands (get_device_reference, walk_device_tree)
- Fix(Med): Remove refs to nonexistent session fields (last_export_path, selected_scene)
- Fix(Med): Ledger key mismatch — memory promotion now reads correct 'action_ledger' key

### Stats
- 236 tools across 31 domains (was 194)
- 1,014 tests passing (was ~400)
- 12 new engine packages
- 36 new MCP tools

## 1.9.14 — Install Reliability + CI Expansion (April 2026)

- Fix(High): `--install` now shows all detected Ableton directories when multiple exist and accepts `LIVEPILOT_INSTALL_PATH` env var to override — previously silently picked the first candidate which could be wrong
- Fix(Med): FastMCP pinned to `>=3.0.0,<3.3.0` with documented private API dependency (`_tool_manager`, `_local_provider`) — prevents upstream drift from breaking schema coercion
- Fix(Med): CI expanded to multi-OS matrix (Ubuntu + macOS + Windows) and added JS entrypoint validation (syntax check, npm pack asset verification)
- Fix(Low/Med): `--setup-flucoma` now enforces SHA256 checksum (TOFU pattern) — first download records the hash, subsequent installs abort on mismatch
- Fix(Low): `--status` timeout path now resolves `true` when `lsof` detects another LivePilot client on the port — matches the explicit STATE_ERROR fix from v1.9.13
- Verification: 145 tests passing, 178 tools confirmed

## 1.9.13 — Security Hardening + Startup Safety (April 2026)

- Fix(P2): `--setup-flucoma` now pins to a known release tag (v1.0.7) instead of unpinned `latest`, prints SHA256 checksum for verification, and selects the platform-specific zip
- Fix(P2): memory subsystem now uses lazy initialization — `TechniqueStore` defers directory creation to first tool call instead of blocking server startup when HOME is read-only
- Fix(P3): `--status` and `--doctor` now return exit 0 when Ableton is reachable but another client is connected (STATE_ERROR = reachable, not failure)
- Fix(P3): negative `limit` values on `memory_recall` and `memory_list` now raise `ValueError` instead of using Python negative slicing
- Fix: Remote Script no longer logs "Server started" before bind succeeds — "Listening on..." is logged from the server loop after successful bind
- Fix: `requirements.txt` now documents dev dependencies (pytest, pytest-asyncio) as comments
- Verification: 145 tests passing, 178 tools confirmed

## 1.9.12 — Deep Audit: 21 Fixes Across 15 Files (April 2026)

**Full codebase audit — 5 critical, 10 important, 6 doc/test fixes.**

### Critical Fixes
- Fix(P1): `capture_stop` no longer deadlocks — `cancel_capture_future` removed lock acquisition that blocked behind `send_capture`
- Fix(P1): `import_midi_to_clip` now distinguishes empty-slot NOT_FOUND from INDEX_ERROR/TIMEOUT instead of swallowing all AbletonConnectionErrors
- Fix(P1): capture audio files now write to `~/Documents/LivePilot/captures/` (stable path) instead of beside the .amxd preset
- Fix(P1): `check_flucoma` now uses `Folder.end` to detect FluCoMa — `typelist` check was always true
- Fix(P1): CI workflow updated to `actions/checkout@v4` + `actions/setup-python@v5` (v6 doesn't exist)

### Safety & Validation
- Fix(P2): 5 automation tools now validate `track_index >= 0` and `clip_index >= 0` (matching all peer modules)
- Fix(P2): `cmd_stop_scrub` now checks `cursor_a.id === 0` for empty clip slots (matching all peer bridge functions)
- Fix(P2): `cmd_get_selected` now resolves return tracks (negative indices) and master track (-1000)
- Fix(P2): `duplicate_track` uses count-before/after delta for correct group track duplication index
- Fix(P2): `create_arrangement_clip` locates first clip by `start_time` instead of stale index after trim pass
- Fix(P2): `get_session_info` reuses already-built lists instead of re-iterating `song.tracks`/`song.scenes`
- Fix(P2): client disconnect race — socket now closes before clearing `_client_connected` flag

### Tests
- Fix: transport validation tests now import production `_validate_tempo`/`_validate_time_signature` instead of testing local copies
- Fix: added `load_sample_to_simpler` to analyzer tool contract (was 28/29)
- Fix: removed duplicate `test_release_quick_verify_checks_both_plugin_manifests`
- New: 5 automation negative tests (index validation, parameter_type validation)

### Documentation
- Fix: `docs/manual/index.md` domain map — Tracks 14→17, Devices 12→15, Scenes 8→12
- Fix: README perception split — 145+33 → 149+29 (actual analyzer tool count is 29)
- Fix: M4L_BRIDGE.md command count — 22→28 (6 commands undocumented)
- Fix: tool-reference.md MIDI docs — `export_clip_midi` and `import_midi_to_clip` parameter tables matched to actual signatures

### Deferred (documented, low-impact)
- Timed-out commands still execute on main thread (needs cancellation token redesign)
- Chunked UDP reassembly fragile on packet loss (loopback mitigates)
- Diatonic transpose octave correction edge case (needs musical test suite)
- `cmd_map_plugin_param` reports false success (LiveAPI lacks Configure mapping API)

Verification: 145 tests passing (non-fastmcp), 178 tools confirmed, 15 files changed

## 1.9.11 — Session Diagnostics + Client Conflict Clarity (March 2026)

**Live-tested against the open Ableton set after reloading the updated Remote Script.**

- Fix(P1): device loading now surfaces post-load plugin health hints, including `opaque_or_failed_plugin`, `sample_dependent`, `plugin_host_status`, and `mcp_sound_design_ready`
- Fix(P1): `get_session_diagnostics` now flags opaque/sample-dependent plugins and no longer crashes on track types that omit standard `arm`/`mute`/`solo` properties
- Fix(P1): analyzer tools now distinguish between “analyzer missing” and “analyzer loaded but bridge/client conflict” when UDP 9880 is unavailable
- Fix(P1): add Hijaz / Phrygian Dominant theory support across key parsing, scale construction, chord building, and `identify_scale`
- Fix(P2): `--status` and TCP timeout paths now explain when another LivePilot client appears to be connected instead of only reporting a generic timeout
- Docs: beat/sounddesign/core skill guidance now includes device-health checks, sample-dependent plugin cautions, and pitch-audit discipline from the live stress-test sessions
- Verification: `292 passed`, `npm pack --dry-run` passed, live set diagnostics succeeded, analyzer bridge streamed on the master track, and conflict reproduction now reports the competing client PID
- Fix(P1): brownian automation curve reflection loop now has 100-iteration guard with hard clamp fallback — high volatility values could previously hang the server
- Fix(P1): schema coercion now recurses into array `items` so `list[float]` params benefit from string-to-number widening for MCP clients that serialize as strings
- Fix(P1): `apply_automation_shape` and `apply_automation_recipe` now validate `parameter_type` and required companion params before sending to Ableton
- Fix(P2): Remote Script `AssertionError` fallbacks now return STATE_ERROR instead of running LOM calls on the TCP thread during ControlSurface disconnection
- Fix(P2): M4L bridge ping version corrected to 1.9.11; `check_flucoma` now probes disk for FluCoMa package instead of returning hardcoded `true`
- Verification: deep audit across 45+ files (3 parallel agents), 292 unit tests + 15 live integration tests against Ableton session, all passing

## 1.9.10 — Analyzer Capture Finalization + Release Sync (March 2026)

**Live-tested in Ableton after a full analyzer rebuild and master-track validation.**

- Fix(P1): `capture_audio` now writes finalized WAV files instead of header-only stubs by correcting the `sfrecord~` start/stop messages in the analyzer patch
- Fix(P1): add a small delayed record start in `LivePilot_Analyzer.maxpat` to avoid the open/start race on fresh capture writes
- Fix(P2): normalize Max-style `Macintosh HD:/Users/...` file paths to POSIX paths in the Python bridge and offline perception tools
- Fix(P2): make OSC string args Unicode-safe end to end with ASCII-safe `b64:` transport and Max-side UTF-8 decode
- Fix(P2): arrangement automation unsupported cases now surface as outer MCP errors instead of fake success payloads
- Fix(P2): missing required Remote Script params now return `INVALID_PARAM` consistently
- Fix(P3): release metadata now treats Codex as the primary plugin manifest with Claude as a mirrored manifest
- Verification: live `capture_audio` wrote a 1.48s WAV from the master track; offline loudness + metadata reads succeeded on the returned path

## 1.9.9 — M4L Bridge Hardening + Deep Audit (March 2026)

**87 tools tested live, 0 failures. 13 bugs fixed across JS bridge + Python tools.**

### M4L Bridge (livepilot_bridge.js)
- Fix(P0): Remove `str_for_value` from all batched JS readers — Auto Filter hangs Max's JS engine (uncatchable), binary-patched .amxd
- Fix(P1): Deferred `udpsend` socket re-initialization via `deferlow` — fixes UDP not sending when device loads from a saved Live Set (socket fails to bind on frozen device restore)
- Fix(P1): Add try-catch to ALL Task.schedule batch functions: cmd_get_params, cmd_get_hidden_params, cmd_get_display_values, cmd_get_auto_state, cmd_get_plugin_params — prevents silent crash on parameter read errors
- Fix(P1): cmd_get_chains_deep, cmd_get_track_cpu, cmd_map_plugin_param — added missing error handling
- Fix(P2): Add `dspstate~` → JS inlet 1 for sample rate reporting (was declared in JS but missing from patcher)
- Fix(P2): Deferred `snapshot~` re-activation via `live.thisdevice` → `deferlow` — safety net for frozen device reload
- Perf: Batch size 4→8, delay 50→20ms (2.5× faster parameter reads)
- Fix: Binary-patch openinpresentation 0→1 in .amxd

### Python MCP Server
- Fix(P1): classify_progression accepts dict inputs `{"root": "F#", "quality": "minor"}` in addition to strings
- Fix(P1): Higher bridge timeouts — hidden_params 15s, display_values 15s, auto_state 10s, plugin_params 20s, plugin_presets 15s, map_plugin 10s
- Fix(P1): load_sample_to_simpler wraps send_command calls in try-except (prevents AbletonConnectionError propagation)
- Fix(P2): _ensure_list catches json.JSONDecodeError → ValueError (6 files: notes, devices, generative, scenes, harmony, automation)
- Fix(P2): _get_m4l/_get_spectral raise ValueError instead of RuntimeError (FastMCP compatibility)

## 1.9.7 — Safe automation fallback + correct clip length reporting (March 2026)

- Fix(P1): set_arrangement_automation places replacement BEFORE deleting original — no data loss if placement fails
- Fix(P2): get_arrangement_clips reports timeline length (not loop span) as length/end_time; loop info as separate fields
- Reverted the effective-length mangling that misreported looped clip sizes

## 1.9.6 — Arrangement clip identification + expression data (March 2026)

- Fix(P1): create_arrangement_clip now identifies new clips by object identity, not position match — prevents mutating pre-existing overlapping clips
- Fix(P2): set_arrangement_automation fallback preserves probability, velocity_deviation, release_velocity when rebuilding notes
- Fix(P2): get_arrangement_clips effective length uses loop_end - loop_start (not just loop_end)

## 1.9.5 — TCP Retry Fix + Arrangement Automation Fix (March 2026)

- Fix(P1): disconnect() now clears _recv_buf — prevents partial JSON corruption on TCP retry
- Fix(P1): set_arrangement_automation fallback copies notes + deletes original clip to avoid silent duplication
- Fix(P2): get_arrangement_clips reports effective length based on loop_end, not raw timeline length
- 2 new connection tests for recv_buf corruption
- 257 tests passing

## 1.9.4 — Doc Sync + M4L Analyzer Fix + Full Validation (March 2026)

**178 tools, all validated live in Ableton. M4L analyzer fully working.**

- Fix: multislider `settype` 0→1 (integer→float) — spectrum bars now render correctly
- Fix: added `loadbang → 1 → snapshot~` init chain for reliable auto-output
- Fix: panel z-order for visible UI in presentation mode
- Binary-patch `openinpresentation` for presentation mode
- Rebuilt .amxd with v1.9 bridge (3 new plugin parameter commands frozen)
- Full live validation: 77 PASS across all 17 domains, FluCoMa 6/6 streams, 255 pytest passing

## 1.9.0 — Scene Matrix, Freeze/Flatten, Plugin Deep Control (March 2026)

**10 new tools (168 → 178), 3 features shipped.**

### Scene Matrix Operations (+4 tools)
- `get_scene_matrix` — full N×M clip grid with states (empty/stopped/playing/triggered/recording)
- `fire_scene_clips` — fire a scene with optional track filter for selective launching
- `stop_all_clips` — stop all playing clips in the session (panic button)
- `get_playing_clips` — return all currently playing or triggered clips

### Track Freeze/Flatten (+3 tools)
- `freeze_track` — freeze a track (render devices to audio for CPU savings)
- `flatten_track` — flatten a frozen track (commit rendered audio permanently)
- `get_freeze_status` — check if a track is frozen

### Plugin Parameter Mapping (+3 tools, M4L)
- `get_plugin_parameters` — get ALL VST/AU plugin parameters including unconfigured ones
- `map_plugin_parameter` — add a plugin parameter to Ableton's Configure list for automation
- `get_plugin_presets` — list a plugin's internal presets and banks

### Infrastructure
- `SLOW_WRITE_COMMANDS` set for freeze_track (35s timeout vs 15s for normal writes)
- Removed "Coming" section from README — all roadmap features shipped or dropped

## 1.8.4 — Bug Fix Audit (March 2026)

**5 bugs fixed (2 P1, 3 P2), verified live in Ableton.**

### P1 — Safety-Critical
- Fix: `create_arrangement_clip` no longer hangs Ableton when `loop_length` is zero or negative — validation at MCP + Remote Script layers
- Fix: `import_midi_to_clip` now preserves the MIDI file's beat grid instead of scaling by session tempo — a 60 BPM MIDI imported at 120 BPM no longer doubles note positions

### P2 — Correctness
- Fix: `create_arrangement_clip` now sets `loop_end` on duplicated clips when `loop_length < source_length`, with documented LOM limitation for arrangement clip resizing
- Fix: `--status` / `--doctor` CLI commands no longer report success for error responses — only resolves true on valid pong
- Fix: `import_midi_to_clip` with `create_clip=True` now checks for existing clips before creating — clears notes if occupied, creates if empty

### Tests
- 2 new tests for MIDI tempo independence (`test_midi_io.py::TestImportTempoIndependence`)
- 255 total tests passing

## 1.8.3 — FluCoMa Wiring + Analyzer Fix (March 2026)

- Fix: wire 6 FluCoMa DSP objects into LivePilot_Analyzer.maxpat (spectral shape, mel bands, chroma, loudness, onset, novelty)
- Fix: onset/novelty Python handlers now accept 1 arg (fluid.onsetfeature~/noveltyfeature~ output single float)
- Fix: restore .amxd after binary corruption — .amxd must be rebuilt via Max editor, not programmatic JSON editing
- Fix: panel z-order in .maxpat — move background panel first in boxes array so multislider renders on top
- FluCoMa perception tools now fully functional when FluCoMa package is installed
- Note: after installing, rebuild .amxd from .maxpat via Max editor (see BUILD_GUIDE.md)

## 1.8.1 — Patch (March 2026)

## 1.6.3 — Audit Hardening (March 2026)

- Fix: cursor aliasing in M4L bridge `walk_device` — nested rack traversal now reads chain/pad counts before recursion clobbers shared cursors
- Fix: `clip_automation.py` — use `get_clip()` for bounds-checked access, add negative index guards, proper validation in `clear_clip_automation`
- Fix: `set_clip_loop` crash when `enabled` param omitted
- Fix: Brownian curve reflection escaping [0,1] for large volatility
- Fix: division by zero in M4L bridge when `sample_rate=0`

## 1.6.2 — Automation Params Fix (March 2026)

- Fix: expose all curve-specific params in `generate_automation_curve` and `apply_automation_shape` MCP tools — `values` (steps), `hits`/`steps` (euclidean), `seed`/`drift`/`volatility` (organic), `damping`/`stiffness` (spring), `control1`/`control2` (bezier), `easing_type`, `narrowing` (stochastic)
- Fix: `analyze_for_automation` spectral getter used wrong method (`.get_spectrum()` → `.get("spectrum")`)

## 1.6.1 — Hotfix (March 2026)

- Fix: `clip_automation.py` imported `register` from `utils` instead of `router`, causing Remote Script to fail to load in Ableton (LivePilot disappeared from Control Surface list)

## 1.6.0 — Automation Intelligence (March 2026)

**8 new tools (127 -> 135), 16-type curve engine, 15 recipes, spectral feedback loop.**

### Automation Curve Engine

### Producer Agent
- New automation phase in production workflow
- Mandatory spectral feedback loop: perceive -> diagnose -> act -> verify -> adjust
- Spectral-driven automation decisions, not just blind curve application

---

## 1.5.0 — Agentic Production System (March 19, 2026)

**Three-layer intelligence: Device Atlas + M4L Analyzer + Technique Memory.**

LivePilot is no longer just a tool server. v1.5.0 reframes the architecture around three layers that give the AI context beyond raw API access:

### Device Atlas
- Structured knowledge corpus of 280+ Ableton devices, 139 drum kits, 350+ impulse responses
- Indexed by category with sonic descriptions, parameter guides, and real browser URIs
- The agent consults the atlas before loading any device — no more hallucinated preset names

### M4L Analyzer (new in v1.1.0, now integrated into the agentic workflow)
- 8-band spectral analysis, RMS/peak metering, pitch tracking, key detection on the master bus
- The agent reads the spectrum after mixing moves to verify results
- Key detection informs harmonic content decisions (bass lines, chord voicings)

### Technique Memory
- Persistent production decisions across sessions: beat patterns, device chains, mix templates, preferences
- `memory_recall` matches on mood, genre, texture — not just names
- The agent consults memory by default before creative decisions, building a profile of the user's taste over time

### Producer Agent
- Updated to use all three layers: atlas for instrument selection, analyzer for verification, memory for style context
- Mandatory health checks between stages now include spectral verification when the analyzer is present

### Documentation
- README rewritten around the three-layer architecture
- Manual updated with agentic approach section
- Skill description reflects the full stack: tools + atlas + analyzer + memory
- Comparison table updated to highlight knowledge, perception, and memory as differentiators

## 1.1.0 — M4L Bridge & Deep LOM Access (March 18-19, 2026)

**23 new tools (104 -> 127), M4L Analyzer device, deep LiveAPI access via Max for Live bridge.**

### M4L Bridge Architecture
- New `LivePilot_Analyzer.amxd` Max for Live Audio Effect for the master track
- UDP/OSC bridge: port 9880 (M4L -> Server), port 9881 (Server -> M4L)
- `livepilot_bridge.js` with 22 bridge commands for deep LOM access
- `SpectralCache` with thread-safe, time-expiring data storage (5s max age)
- Graceful degradation: all 104 core tools work without the analyzer device
- Base64-encoded JSON responses with chunked transfer for large payloads (>1400 bytes)
- OSC addresses sent WITHOUT leading `/` to fix Max `udpreceive` messagename dispatch

### New Tools: Analyzer Domain (20 tools)

**Spectral Analysis (3):**
- `get_master_spectrum` — 8-band frequency analysis (sub/low/low-mid/mid/high-mid/high/presence/air)
- `get_master_rms` — real-time RMS, peak, and pitch from the master bus
- `get_detected_key` — Krumhansl-Schmuckler key detection algorithm on accumulated pitch data

**Deep LOM Access (4):**
- `get_hidden_parameters` — all device parameters including hidden ones not in ControlSurface API
- `get_automation_state` — automation state for all parameters (active/overridden)
- `walk_device_tree` — recursive device chain tree walking (racks, drum pads, nested devices, 6 levels deep)
- `get_display_values` — human-readable parameter values as shown in Live's UI (e.g., "440 Hz", "-6.0 dB")

**Simpler Operations (7):**
- `replace_simpler_sample` — load audio file into Simpler by absolute path (requires existing sample)
- `load_sample_to_simpler` — full workflow: bootstrap Simpler via browser, then replace sample
- `get_simpler_slices` — get slice point positions (frames and seconds) from Simpler
- `crop_simpler` — crop sample to active region
- `reverse_simpler` — reverse sample in Simpler
- `warp_simpler` — time-stretch sample to fit N beats at current tempo
- `get_clip_file_path` — get audio file path on disk for a clip

**Warp Markers (4):**
- `get_warp_markers` — get all warp markers (beat_time + sample_time) from audio clips
- `add_warp_marker` — add warp marker at beat position
- `move_warp_marker` — move warp marker to new beat position (tempo manipulation)
- `remove_warp_marker` — remove warp marker at beat position

**Clip Preview (2):**
- `scrub_clip` — scrub/preview clip at specific beat position
- `stop_scrub` — stop scrub preview

### New Tools: Mixing Domain (3 tools)
- `get_track_routing` — get input/output routing info for a track
- `set_track_routing` — set input/output routing by display name
- `get_mix_snapshot` — one-call full mix state (all meters, volumes, pans, sends, master)

### Bugs Fixed

**M4L Bridge Fixes:**
- OSC addresses: removed leading `/` from outgoing commands — Max `udpreceive` passes the `/` as part of the messagename to JS, breaking the dispatch switch statement
- `str_for_value` requires `call()` not `get()` — it's a function, not a property in Max JS LiveAPI
- `warp_markers` is a dict property returning a JSON string, not LOM children — requires `JSON.parse()` on the raw `get()` result
- `SimplerDevice.slices` lives on the `sample` child object (`device sample slices`), not on the device directly
- `replace_sample` only works on Simplers that already have a sample loaded — silently fails on empty Simplers
- `get()` in Max JS LiveAPI always returns arrays — must index or convert appropriately
- `openinpresentation` attribute in .amxd doesn't persist from Max editor saves — requires binary patching

**M4L Analyzer Display Fixes:**
- Injected `settype Float` messages to fix spectrum bar display (was showing integer 0/1)
- Fixed `vexpr` scaling factor from 10 to 200 for proper bar visualization range
- Fixed freeze/JS caching: Max freezes JS from its search path cache (`~/Documents/Max 8/...`), not from the source file directory

**Tool Fixes:**
- Fixed key detection passthrough from streaming cache to bridge query fallback
- Fixed parameter name case-sensitivity in hidden parameter reads
- Fixed input validation on several analyzer tools (missing clip/track validation)
- Fixed `load_sample_to_simpler` bootstrap: searches browser for any sample, loads it to create Simpler, then replaces

### LiveAPI Insights Documented
- `get()` returns arrays in Max JS LiveAPI (even for scalar properties)
- `call()` vs `get()` distinction for functions vs properties
- `.amxd` binary format: 24-byte `ampf` header + `ptch` chunk + `mx@c` header + JSON patcher + frozen dependencies
- Binary patching technique: same-byte-count string replacements preserve file structure
- Max freezes JS from cache path, not source directory — must copy to `~/Documents/Max 8/`

### Technical
- New `mcp_server/m4l_bridge.py` module: `SpectralCache`, `SpectralReceiver`, `M4LBridge` classes
- New `mcp_server/tools/analyzer.py`: 20 MCP tools for the analyzer domain
- New `m4l_device/livepilot_bridge.js`: 22 bridge commands
- New `m4l_device/LivePilot_Analyzer.amxd`: compiled M4L device
