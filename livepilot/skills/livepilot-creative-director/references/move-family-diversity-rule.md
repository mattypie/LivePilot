# Move-Family Diversity Rule

The single mechanical rule that prevents pattern-repetition: when the
director generates three plans, their DOMINANT moves must come from
three DIFFERENT `move.family` values.

This is not taste. This is a structural constraint enforced before
preview or ranking.

## Family vs. dimension — two different axes

The director reasons on two orthogonal axes:

- **`move.family`** — WHERE in the semantic_moves registry the dominant
  move lives. Six stable values, code-enforced. This is what the
  diversity rule operates on.
- **`dimension`** — WHAT kind of musical consequence the plan has.
  Four values: structural / rhythmic / timbral / spatial. This is what
  the four-move rule operates on.

A rhythmic plan has a rhythmic DIMENSION but its FAMILY is typically
`arrangement` (clip-level pattern change) or `sound_design` (per-hit
timbre variation that changes feel). That is **not** a fudge — it is
the correct taxonomy, because rhythmic work in Ableton happens via
note editing + grooves, which are tooled through those families. Tag
such a seed with `dimension_hint: "rhythmic"` so downstream evaluation
knows what dimension was touched.

## The seven canonical families

Source of truth: the semantic-move registry, populated by both
`mcp_server/semantic_moves/*.py` AND `mcp_server/sample_engine/moves.py`.
Never invent an eighth family at the director level.

| Family | What it covers | Typical moves | Maps to dimension |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mix` | Level / EQ / dynamics / space-via-send / stereo | `tighten_low_end`, `widen_stereo`, `make_punchier`, `darken_without_losing_width`, `reduce_repetition_fatigue`, `make_kick_bass_lock`, `reduce_foreground_competition` | spatial (usually) |
| `arrangement` | Section-level structure, clip density, and clip-level rhythmic edits | `refresh_repeated_section`, plus structural moves in `mix_moves.py`. Rhythmic plans that edit notes / grooves / motifs sit here via `dimension_hint: "rhythmic"`. | structural — or rhythmic with dimension_hint |
| `transition` | Between-section energy and motion | `create_buildup_tension`, `smooth_scene_handoff`, `increase_contrast_before_payoff`, `bridge_sections`, `open_chorus`, `create_breakdown`, `increase_forward_motion` | structural |
| `sound_design` | Timbre of individual sources. Per-hit velocity / probability / micro-timing variations also sit here when they change feel, not pattern. | `add_warmth`, `add_texture`, `shape_transients`, `add_space` | timbral — or rhythmic with dimension_hint when per-hit-timing oriented |
| `performance` | Live-safe energy shaping | `recover_energy`, `decompress_tension`, `safe_spotlight`, `emergency_simplify` | (context-specific) |
| `device_creation` | New device / rack / instrument load. Generates Max for Live M4L devices procedurally. | `create_chaos_modulator`, `create_feedback_resonator`, `create_wavefolder_effect`, `create_bitcrusher_effect`, `create_karplus_string`, `create_stochastic_texture`, `create_fdn_reverb` | timbral |
| `sample` | Sample-based creative moves — chop, layer, stretch, resample, one-shot. Lives in `sample_engine/moves.py`. | `sample_chop_rhythm`, `sample_texture_layer`, `sample_vocal_ghost`, `sample_break_layer`, `sample_resample_destroy`, `sample_one_shot_accent` | rhythmic (chop / break / one-shot) or timbral (texture / vocal_ghost / resample) |

**Discovery:** always call `list_semantic_moves(domain=<family>)` at
runtime to enumerate — do not hardcode move IDs. Families are stable;
the move catalog grows. As of v1.26.3 the runtime returns 44 moves
across all 7 domains.

**Why the director never invents an eighth `rhythmic` family:** the
move registry is the execution substrate. A family that exists in
documentation but not in `semantic_moves/*.py` or `sample_engine/moves.py`
cannot be compiled into an experiment seed via the registry path. It
would force every rhythmic seed onto the `freeform` / `technique`
source path with a hand-assembled `compiled_plan`. Cleaner to keep the
family set code-aligned and use `dimension_hint` to record the musical
consequence.

**Note on the `sample` family:** sample-based creative work was
historically documented as "sample_engine is not a semantic_move
family" (see the Sample-heavy workflows section below). That was wrong
— v1.18.0 verification against `list_semantic_moves()` confirmed
`sample` is a legitimate domain with 6 moves. Prefer sample-family
moves over tagging sample work as `sound_design` or `device_creation`
when the dominant operation IS chopping / stretching / resampling.

## The rule

Generate three seeds. For each seed, identify its DOMINANT move (the
first step in the compiled plan, or the single `move_id` for
`source="semantic_move"` seeds). The `.family` attribute of those three
dominant moves must be three different values from the canonical set.

```
plan_A.dominant.family != plan_B.dominant.family
plan_B.dominant.family != plan_C.dominant.family
plan_A.dominant.family != plan_C.dominant.family
```

If any two match → regenerate the offending plan from a different family.

## Low-novelty escape hatch

The 3-distinct-families rule exists to prevent collapse-to-mode on
creative intent. But "creative intent" spans a wide novelty range (see
`creative-brief-template.md` novelty_budget table). At the conservative
end, the rule fights against the user's ask.

**If the brief's `novelty_budget < 0.35`** (e.g., "keep the vibe, just
cleaner", "tighten it up", "final polish"), the 3-family rule is
RELAXED:

| novelty_budget | Minimum distinct families |
|---|---|
| `< 0.35` | 1-2 is honest; 3 is fabricated |
| `0.35 – 0.50` | 2 minimum; 3 ideal |
| `> 0.50` | 3 required (standard rule) |

**Rationale:** low novelty_budget signals refinement, not exploration.
A user asking "make it cleaner" under an active Basic Channel packet
rightly gets 1-2 mix-family plans (low-end clean-up, tail tail-taming,
send level adjustment) — inventing a structural or sound_design plan
for them would ignore what they asked for. That's exactly the
"generic_fallback" failure mode the verdict taxonomy catches on the
OTHER end — the director shouldn't produce it preemptively by forcing
divergence the user didn't want.

**Honesty requirements when the escape hatch applies:**
- State the novelty_budget value in the brief's notes
- Name the rule: "Low-novelty escape hatch — 3-family rule relaxed"
- Still differentiate the 1-2 plans meaningfully (different target,
  different parameter direction) — the rule relaxation is about the
  family-count constraint, NOT the no-fabricated-distinctness rule
  which applies always

**Anti-pattern under the escape hatch:** shipping 2 plans that are
"same move with different EQ Q" or "same send at different levels".
Even under relaxed family rules, plans must have distinct musical
consequence. Use different TARGETS (different tracks) or different
MECHANISMS (EQ vs. Utility gain vs. saturator input drive) to stay
honest.

## How to pick the dominant move for a multi-step seed

For `source="freeform"` / `"synthesis"` / `"composer"` / `"technique"`
seeds that arrive with a compiled plan:

1. The dominant move is the step with the **highest musical consequence**,
   not the first step in execution order.
2. Heuristic: a step that changes identity (new device, new section,
   new timbre) outranks a step that tunes parameters.
3. If ambiguous: tag the seed with a `family_hint` in the seed dict and
   use that.

## Anti-examples — fabricated distinctness

**REJECT these seed sets.** They look different but collapse to one pattern:

- Three `mix` plans with different EQ curves on the same track
  → all `family="mix"` — the agent is converging to "mixing".
- `add_warmth` + `add_texture` + `add_space` — all three are `sound_design`.
  The agent found the sound-design hammer and is hitting everything.
- Three seeds using different references (Villalobos / Basic Channel /
  Gas) but all routing to `sound_design` moves — reference diversity
  is not family diversity.
- Two plans that both add a send to the same reverb with different levels.

**ACCEPT these:** family is actually different.

- Plan A: `arrangement` (breakdown at bar 48) + Plan B: `sound_design`
  (dub chord on pad) + Plan C: `mix` (widen_stereo on hats bus)
- Plan A: `transition` (increase_forward_motion into drop) + Plan B:
  `device_creation` (add Granulator III on vocal) + Plan C:
  `sound_design` (shape_transients on kick)

## Edge cases

### User pre-locked a dimension

If the brief's `locked_dimensions` excludes one or more dimensions
(e.g., "don't touch the arrangement"), the families that map to those
dimensions are off-limits. See `the-four-move-rule.md` for the map.

With one lock: the remaining families still must differ across three plans.
With two locks: only 2 dimensions left — ship 2 plans, not 3 (honesty rule).

### Mix excluded by recency — family-collision risk

When the recency rule excludes `mix` (≥ 5 of 10 in `get_action_ledger_summary(limit=10)`), the
natural fallback plans often collapse into two `arrangement`-family
plans — one structural (insert a breakdown) and one rhythmic (clip
groove + probability edits). Both are honest `arrangement` with
different `dimension_hint` tags, but the diversity rule requires three
distinct families.

**Pre-empt the collision:** when `mix` is excluded and you want both
structural AND rhythmic coverage, route the structural plan through
`transition` family (`create_breakdown`, `create_buildup_tension`,
`bridge_sections`, `increase_forward_motion`) rather than
`arrangement`. Both families can deliver structural consequence;
`transition` is the one that leaves `arrangement` free for the
rhythmic plan.

Allowed combinations when mix is excluded:
- `transition` (structural) + `arrangement` (rhythmic) + `sound_design` (timbral) ✅
- `arrangement` (structural) + `sound_design` (rhythmic, per-hit) + `device_creation` (timbral) ✅
- `arrangement` (structural) + `arrangement` (rhythmic) — ❌ family collision, regenerate

### Fewer than three families plausibly apply

Example: the user's "more warmth on the master" request genuinely only
has `mix` and `sound_design` as credible families. Do NOT fabricate a
`device_creation` plan to hit three.

- Ship two plans across the two real families
- Document explicitly: "Only 2 plans — the ask narrows to {mix,
  sound_design}; forcing a third would be theatre."
- This is inherited from Wonder's honesty rule
- This is ACCEPTABLE on stuck-rescue contexts; on a first-pass creative
  call, re-read the concept packet and check whether a third family
  was overlooked before giving up

### The concept packet mandates a family

If the packet's `reach_for.techniques` cluster in one family, use that
family for the dominant plan — but the OTHER two plans still vary.
Packet specifies the center; diversity rule specifies the spread.

### Sample-heavy workflows

As of v1.18.0, `sample` IS a semantic_move family (registry lives in
`sample_engine/moves.py`). For dominant-sample work, prefer sample-
family moves directly:

- Rhythmic chopping → `sample_chop_rhythm` or `sample_break_layer`
- Atmospheric layering → `sample_texture_layer`
- Vocal transformation → `sample_vocal_ghost`
- Destructive transformation → `sample_resample_destroy`
- Punctuation → `sample_one_shot_accent`

Only fall back to `sound_design` or `device_creation` when the dominant
action is PATCH-level programming or NEW-device loading rather than
sample-level manipulation. Loading Simpler with a degraded source,
for instance, is `device_creation` (loading the instrument); chopping
an already-loaded sample is `sample`.

### Rhythmic plans

A rhythmic plan (one whose primary consequence is swing / ghost-note
programming / probability / motif transformation / groove assignment)
dominates as `arrangement` if it edits clip content or pattern, OR as
`sound_design` if it shapes per-hit timbre/velocity in a way that
changes feel. Always attach `dimension_hint: "rhythmic"` to the seed.

Two rhythmic plans across a diverse set are fine IF their dominant
families differ (one `arrangement`, one `sound_design`). Two rhythmic
plans both tagged `arrangement` = fabricated distinctness by the same
rule that forbids two `mix` plans.

## What to write into the turn

After Phase 3 generation, explicitly state the family split. Example:

> Three plans:
> - **A (sound_design):** Dub chord stab into filtered delay send.
> - **B (arrangement):** Negative-space breakdown at bar 48, ghost percussion only.
> - **C (mix):** Widen stereo on hats bus, narrow sub to mono under 80 Hz.

This makes the diversity legible and auditable by the user.

## Why this works

"Pattern repetition" is a signal that the agent keeps choosing the same
family (usually `mix` or `sound_design`, because those are the
easiest/safest). Forcing three families forces the agent to consider
structural and transitional moves it would otherwise skip. That is
where the "distinct musical idea, not just distinct parameters"
property comes from.
