# LivePilot Core — Ableton Live 12

Agentic production system for Ableton Live 12. 467 tools across 56 domains, three layers:

- **Device Atlas** — 5264 devices indexed (120 enriched with sonic intelligence, 683 drum kits). Consult `atlas_search` or `atlas_suggest` before loading any device. Never guess a device name.
- **M4L Analyzer** — Real-time audio analysis on the master bus (9-band spectrum sub_low → air, RMS/peak, key detection). Optional — all core tools work without it.
- **Technique Memory** — Persistent storage for production decisions. Consult `memory_recall` before creative tasks to understand user taste.

## Golden Rules

1. **Always call `get_session_info` first** — know the session before changing anything
2. **Verify after every write** — re-read state to confirm changes took effect
3. **Use `undo` liberally** — mention it to users when doing destructive ops
4. **One operation at a time** — verify between steps
5. **Track indices are 0-based** — negative for return tracks (-1=A, -2=B), -1000 for master
6. **NEVER invent device/preset names** — consult `atlas_search` or `atlas_suggest` first, then use `search_browser` and load the exact `uri` from results. Exception: `find_and_load_device` for built-in effects only ("Reverb", "Delay", "Compressor", "EQ Eight", "Saturator", "Utility")
7. **Color indices 0-69** — Ableton's fixed palette
8. **Volume 0.0-1.0, pan -1.0 to 1.0** — normalized, not dB
9. **Tempo range 20-999 BPM**
10. **Always name tracks and clips** — organization is part of the process
11. **Respect tool speed tiers** — see below
12. **ALWAYS report tool errors** — never silently swallow errors. Include: tool name, error message, fallback plan
13. **Verify plugin health after loading** — check `health_flags`, `mcp_sound_design_ready`, `plugin_host_status`. If `parameter_count` <= 1 on AU/VST → dead plugin, delete and replace
14. **Use `C hijaz` for Hijaz/Phrygian Dominant keys** — avoids false out-of-key warnings
15. **VERIFY AFTER EVERY WRITE** — mandatory, non-negotiable:
    - After `set_device_parameter` or `batch_set_parameters`: read `value_string` in the response to confirm the actual Hz/dB/% value makes sense
    - After any filter, EQ, or effect parameter change: call `get_track_meters(include_stereo=true)` and verify the target track has non-zero left AND right levels
    - After `apply_automation_recipe`: check that the recipe didn't push the parameter to an extreme that kills audio
    - **`batch_set_parameters` schema gotcha**: the `parameters` argument
      is a dict of `{"ParamName": {"value": v}}`, NOT `{"ParamName": v}`.
      The bare-value shape raises `Each parameter entry must include 'value'`.
      Live-verified v1.18.0 — example:
      ```
      batch_set_parameters(
          track_index=-1, device_index=0,
          parameters={"Feedback": {"value": 0.45}, "Channel Mode": {"value": 1}}
      )
      ```
      (For single params, `set_device_parameter` takes the value directly —
      only `batch_set_parameters` wraps it in a dict.)
    - If a track's stereo output drops to 0: the effect is killing the signal — check `get_device_parameters` for `value_string`, fix, re-verify
    - **Parameter ranges are NOT always 0-1.** Auto Filter Frequency is 20-135. Bit Depth is 1-16. Always read `value_string` to see actual units.
16. **NEVER apply automation recipes without understanding the target parameter's range** — recipes generate 0-1 curves that get auto-scaled for device parameters, but always verify the result
17. **LivePilot_Analyzer must be LAST on master chain** — always place after ALL effects (EQ, Compressor, Utility, etc.) so it measures the final post-processing output, not the raw signal. When loading effects on master, either load them before the analyzer or move the analyzer to end afterward
18. **Remote Script reload workflow** — after any edit to `remote_script/LivePilot/*.py`: run `npx livepilot --install` (NOT `node installer/install.js` — that raw file only module-exports the install function and silently no-ops as a script), then call `reload_handlers` (MCP tool, domain: diagnostics). NEVER instruct the user to toggle the Control Surface in Live Preferences. The tool uses pkgutil + importlib to re-fire `@register` decorators in-place in <1s while the TCP connection stays open. Standard procedure for every handler change — not just releases

## Tool Speed Tiers

### Instant (<1s) — Use freely
All 467 tools plus M4L perception tools.

### Fast (1-5s) — Use freely
`analyze_loudness` · `analyze_mix` · `analyze_sound_design`

### Slow (5-15s) — Tell the user first
`compare_to_reference` · `analyze_spectrum_offline` · `read_audio_metadata`

**Escalation pattern:** Start fast, escalate only with consent:
```
Level 1 (instant):  get_master_spectrum + get_track_meters
Level 2 (fast):     analyze_loudness + analyze_mix
Level 3 (slow):     compare_to_reference + analyze_spectrum_offline
```

## Error Handling Protocol

Report ALL errors to the user immediately. Common failure modes:
- **Dead AU/VST plugin** — `parameter_count` <= 1 → delete, replace with native
- **Sample-dependent plugin** — granular synths produce silence without samples → use self-contained synths (Wavetable, Operator, Drift, Analog)
- **Empty Drum Rack** — bare rack = silence → always load a kit preset
- **M4L bridge timeout** — device may be busy or removed → retry or skip analyzer features
- **Connection timeout** — Ableton unresponsive → check if session is heavy
- **Volume reset on scene fire** — Ableton restores mixer state when firing scenes. Always re-apply `set_track_volume`/`set_track_pan` after `fire_scene` if your mix settings differ from what was stored in the clips
- **M4L Analyzer not connected** — if `get_master_spectrum` errors with "Analyzer not detected", call `ensure_analyzer_on_master`. If it returns `install_required`, call `install_m4l_device(source_path="<repo>/m4l_device/LivePilot_Analyzer.amxd")` and retry. If it errors with "UDP bridge not connected", try `reconnect_bridge` first
- **Another client connected** — Remote Script only accepts one TCP client on port 9878. If you see this error, the MCP server is already connected. Use MCP tools instead of raw TCP

## Technique Memory

Three modes:
- **Informed (default):** `memory_recall` before creative tasks, let past decisions influence new ones
- **Fresh:** Skip memory when user wants something new ("ignore my history", "surprise me")
- **Explicit recall:** `memory_recall` → `memory_get` → `memory_replay` when user references a saved technique

## Wonder Mode — Stuck-Rescue Routing

- Use Wonder (`enter_wonder_mode`) for creative ambiguity and session rescue
- Do not fabricate three variants when only one real option exists
- Do not describe a branch as previewable unless it has a valid `compiled_plan`
- Prefer Wonder when `detect_stuckness` confidence > 0.5
- Prefer Wonder when the user's request is emotionally-shaped, not parametric
- Load `livepilot-wonder` skill for full workflow guidance

## Creative Sound Design Knowledge

Before setting device parameters, consult the knowledge corpus for informed creative choices. Read the relevant file BEFORE making changes:

| User says | Read this file |
|-----------|---------------|
| "make it breathe" / "organic" / "alive" / "warm" / "cold" / "anxious" / "nostalgic" | `references/device-knowledge/creative-thinking.md` — emotional-to-technical mapping, physical world modeling |
| "what effect chain for [genre]" / "dub techno" / "trap" / "SOPHIE" / "Arca" / "ambient" | `references/device-knowledge/chains-genre.md` — complete chains per genre |
| "how to use Wavetable/Drift/Analog/Operator/Meld" | `references/device-knowledge/instruments-synths.md` — parameter-level recipes |
| "distortion" / "saturation" / "Roar" / "Saturator" / "Redux" | `references/device-knowledge/effects-distortion.md` — every curve type, creative applications |
| "reverb" / "delay" / "echo" / "space" / "dub" | `references/device-knowledge/effects-space.md` — dub recipes, shimmer chains |
| "spectral" / "Resonators" / "Corpus" / "Vocoder" / "weird" / "experimental" | `references/device-knowledge/effects-spectral.md` — drum-to-melody, cross-synthesis |
| "automate" / "evolve" / "arc" / "movement" / "filter sweep" | `references/device-knowledge/automation-as-music.md` — shapes, macro gestures, density mapping |
| "sound design" / "make it interesting" / "more complex" | `references/sound-design-deep.md` — minimal-techno, SOPHIE, Basic Channel master techniques |

**Rule:** Never set effect parameters from memory alone when the corpus has specific guidance. Read the file first, then apply the technique.

## Domain Skills

For domain-specific workflows, load the appropriate skill:

| Skill | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `livepilot-devices` | Loading, browsing, configuring devices and presets |
| `livepilot-notes` | Writing notes, theory, generative algorithms, MIDI I/O |
| `livepilot-mixing` | Volume, pan, sends, routing, automation |
| `livepilot-arrangement` | Song structure, scenes, arrangement view |

## V2 Engine Skills

For agentic evaluation loops, load the appropriate engine skill:

| Skill | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `livepilot-creative-director` | **Load FIRST on any open-ended creative request** — "like X", "develop", "mutate", "more interesting", reference/style asks. Compiles a Creative Brief and enforces 3-plan divergence across `move.family` before any commit. Routes to the skills below. |
| `livepilot-mix-engine` | Critic-driven mix analysis and iterative improvement |
| `livepilot-sound-design-engine` | Critic-driven patch analysis and refinement |
| `livepilot-composition-engine` | Section analysis, transitions, motifs, form |
| `livepilot-performance-engine` | Live performance with safety constraints |
| `livepilot-evaluation` | Universal before/after evaluation loop |

## Reference Corpus

Deep production knowledge in `references/`:

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `references/overview.md` | All 467 tools with params and ranges |
| `references/device-atlas/` | 280+ device corpus with URIs and presets |
| `references/device-knowledge/` | Per-device parameter + technique knowledge |
| `references/pack-knowledge.md` | All 44 installed packs scored for aesthetic fit (Tier S / A / B / C), with Top / Use-when guidance |
| `references/artist-vocabularies.md` | **v1.17+** — ~25 producers (Villalobos, Hawtin, Basic Channel, Gas, Basinski, Hecker, Aphex, Dilla, Burial, Henke, Daft Punk, …) mapped to `reach_for` LivePilot devices + `avoid` anti-patterns + `key_techniques` cross-refs. The LLM's bridge from "sound like X" to concrete tool calls. |
| `references/genre-vocabularies.md` | **v1.17+** — 15 genres (microhouse, dub_techno, deep_minimal, minimal_techno, ambient, idm, modern_classical, hip_hop, trap, dubstep, house, dnb, garage, experimental, synthwave) with tempo / kick / bass / percussion / harmonic / texture / reach-for / avoid structure |
| `references/sound-design-deep.md` | Masters-level sound design principles (Basic Channel space-as-composition, Hawtin subtraction-over-addition, micro-modulation, space as composition) — explicitly "not a recipe book" |
| `references/sample-manipulation.md` | 29 sample techniques (slice_and_sequence, micro_chop, vocal_chop_rhythm, extreme_stretch, dub_throw, tail_harvest, granular_scatter, …) with producer references (Burial, Dilla, Amon Tobin, Stars of the Lid) |
| `references/midi-recipes.md` | Drum patterns, chord voicings, humanization |
| `references/sound-design.md` | Synth recipes, device chain patterns |
| `references/mixing-patterns.md` | Gain staging, compression, EQ, stereo |
| `references/automation-atlas.md` | 16 curve types, 15 recipes, spectral mapping |
| `references/ableton-workflow-patterns.md` | Session/arrangement workflows |
| `references/memory-guide.md` | Technique memory usage and quality templates |
| `references/m4l-devices.md` | M4L bridge command reference |

**For aesthetic queries ("sound like X", "make me a <genre> track"), read
`artist-vocabularies.md` + `genre-vocabularies.md` BEFORE selecting devices.**
They're structured translation layers between the LLM's training and
LivePilot's atlas — not recipe scripts.

## V2 Orchestration Layer

For complex requests, use the V2 orchestration flow instead of ad-hoc tool calls. There are **two peer flows** — choose based on intent.

**For creative intent** (reference / style / "more interesting" / open-ended): load `livepilot-creative-director` BEFORE choosing a flow. It compiles a Creative Brief, enforces 3-plan divergence across `move.family`, and routes through Flow B with the right seeds.

### Flow A — Targeted (recipe-first, for specific fixes)
Use when the user has a concrete, specific request ("tighten the low end", "make the drums punchier", "fix the masking").

1. **`route_request`** — classify the request, get recommended engines and workflow mode
2. **`get_session_kernel`** — build the unified turn snapshot
3. **`propose_next_best_move`** — get ranked semantic move suggestions (taste-aware)
4. **`preview_semantic_move`** — see what a move will do before committing
5. **`apply_semantic_move(mode="improve")`** — compile the move and return the concrete plan for approval; after approval, execute the returned steps individually
6. **Evaluate** — use the appropriate evaluator after the approved steps actually run

### Flow B — Exploratory (branch-native, for creative search)
Use when the user wants options, variants, or is stuck ("surprise me", "try some things", "I don't know what I want", "make it more like X"). **Flow B is also correct when `route_request` returns `workflow_mode="creative_search"`.**

1. **`get_session_kernel`** — include creative controls when relevant:
   - `freshness=0.8` to bias toward surprise (default 0.5)
   - `creativity_profile="alchemist"` / `"surgeon"` / `"sculptor"` to set producer philosophy
   - `sacred_elements=[...]` if the user named protected parts
   - `synth_hints={"track_indices": [...], "preferred_devices": [...]}` for synth work
2. **`create_experiment`** with *seeds*, not just move_ids:
   - Each seed is a `BranchSeed` dict (or let Wonder emit them for you)
   - Seeds with source `"semantic_move"` compile via the registry at run time
   - Seeds with source `"freeform" / "synthesis" / "composer" / "technique"` must arrive with a pre-compiled plan attached via the parallel `compiled_plans=[...]` list
3. **`run_experiment`** — trials each branch; respects pre-compiled plans
4. **`compare_experiments`** — rank by score
5. **`commit_experiment`** — apply winner; or `discard_experiment` to throw everything away

**Rule of thumb**: if the user asked for a specific fix, Flow A. If they asked "what would you do?" or mentioned feel/vibe without parameters, Flow B.

### Semantic Moves
High-level musical intents that compile to deterministic tool sequences. 7 families (44 moves as of v1.27.1):
- **mix** — `tighten_low_end`, `widen_stereo`, `make_punchier`, `darken_without_losing_width`, `reduce_repetition_fatigue`, `make_kick_bass_lock`, `reduce_foreground_competition`
- **arrangement** — `refresh_repeated_section`, plus structural moves defined alongside mix
- **transition** — `create_buildup_tension`, `smooth_scene_handoff`, `increase_contrast_before_payoff`, `bridge_sections`, `increase_forward_motion`, `open_chorus`, `create_breakdown`
- **sound_design** — `add_warmth`, `add_texture`, `shape_transients`, `add_space`
- **performance** — `recover_energy`, `decompress_tension`, `safe_spotlight`, `emergency_simplify`
- **device_creation** — `create_chaos_modulator`, `create_feedback_resonator`, `create_wavefolder_effect`, `create_bitcrusher_effect`, `create_karplus_string`, `create_stochastic_texture`, `create_fdn_reverb` (procedural M4L device generation)
- **sample** — `sample_chop_rhythm`, `sample_texture_layer`, `sample_vocal_ghost`, `sample_break_layer`, `sample_resample_destroy`, `sample_one_shot_accent` (registered from `sample_engine/moves.py`)

Use `list_semantic_moves(domain="mix")` to discover available moves.

### Experiment Branching — Seed-Based (canonical, PR3+)

Experiments support both the legacy `move_ids` path and the new `seeds` path. Prefer `seeds` for anything exploratory:

```
# Legacy / targeted — one semantic_move per branch:
create_experiment(request_text="make it punchier", move_ids=["make_punchier", "widen_stereo"])

# Branch-native / exploratory — mixed sources, pre-compiled plans allowed:
create_experiment(
    request_text="surprise me",
    seeds=[
        {"seed_id": "a", "source": "semantic_move", "move_id": "make_punchier",
         "novelty_label": "safe", "risk_label": "low"},
        {"seed_id": "b", "source": "freeform", "hypothesis": "Audio-rate LFO into filter cutoff",
         "novelty_label": "unexpected", "risk_label": "medium"},
        {"seed_id": "c", "source": "synthesis", "hypothesis": "Wavetable morph across positions",
         "novelty_label": "strong"},
    ],
    compiled_plans=[None, {"steps": [...], "step_count": N}, {"steps": [...], "step_count": M}],
)
```

**Never claim a branch is previewable unless it has a valid `compiled_plan`.** Analytical-only branches (no plan, or seed marked `analytical_only=true`) short-circuit to a neutral evaluation — they're directional suggestions, not executable paths.

### Branch Status Vocabulary
Branches carry a status string that governs lifecycle:
- `pending` — created, not yet run
- `running` — apply pass in progress
- `evaluated` — ran and was scored; may be kept or discarded
- `committed` / `committed_with_errors` — winner was applied permanently
- `discarded` — rolled back or abandoned
- `interesting_but_failed` — (PR7+) failed hard technical gates but surfaced novel ideas; kept for audit, not re-applied
- `failed` — couldn't apply any steps; do not claim success

### Taste-Aware Ranking
The system learns user preferences from kept/undone moves:
- `get_taste_graph()` — current taste model
- `explain_taste_inference()` — human-readable explanation
- `rank_moves_by_taste(move_specs)` — sort options by preference fit
- `propose_next_best_move` automatically applies taste ranking when evidence exists

### Musical Intelligence
Song-level analysis beyond parameters:
- `detect_repetition_fatigue()` — clip overuse, section staleness
- `detect_role_conflicts()` — tracks fighting for the same space
- `infer_section_purposes()` — label sections as setup/tension/payoff/contrast/release
- `score_emotional_arc()` — does the song have a satisfying build→climax→resolve?
- `analyze_phrase_arc()` — capture and evaluate musical phrases
- `compare_phrase_renders()` — compare phrase variants side by side
