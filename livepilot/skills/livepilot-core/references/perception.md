# Perception (Analyzer) Reference

Deep-dive detail for `mcp_server/tools/analyzer.py` tools. The tool
docstrings carry a trimmed operational contract (params, ranges,
gotchas); this file carries the full band tables, classification
thresholds, and historical bug context that motivated each behavior.
Read this before deep spectral/health-check work — the tool docstrings
point back here for the parts that don't change from call to call.

## `get_master_spectrum` — 9-band table

Band energies (fffb~ center frequencies shown in parens), values 0.0-1.0:

| Band | Range | Center | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| sub_low | 20-60 Hz | ~35 Hz | kick fundamentals, deep sub-bass |
| sub | 60-120 Hz | ~85 Hz | 808s, sub-bass body |
| low | 120-250 Hz | ~175 Hz | bass body, warmth |
| low_mid | 250-500 Hz | ~350 Hz | mud zone, male vocal lows |
| mid | 500 Hz-1 kHz | ~700 Hz | vocal presence, snare body |
| high_mid | 1-2 kHz | ~1.4 kHz | consonants, pick attack |
| high | 2-4 kHz | ~2.8 kHz | presence, vocal intelligibility |
| presence | 4-8 kHz | ~5.6 kHz | cymbal definition, air of breath |
| air | 8-20 kHz | ~12 kHz | shimmer, sparkle |

Older `.amxd` builds (pre-v1.16) emit the legacy 8-band layout without
the explicit `sub_low` split — the server auto-detects band count from
the OSC payload and picks the right name set. Re-freeze the Max device
to get the 9-band resolution.

**BUG-2026-04-22#6 fix — windowed averaging.** Kick transients make
single snapshots swing wildly (0.45 → 0.05 → 0.16 within a bar). The
`window_ms` param samples the cache over a time window and mean-pools
instead of returning one instantaneous frame.

**BUG-2026-04-22#15 fix — sub-band resolution.** `sub_detail=True`
derives three finer buckets from the FluCoMa 40-band mel spectrum
(band 0-1 ≈ sub_deep 0-45 Hz — kick fundamental, band 2 ≈ sub_mid
45-60 Hz — 808 body/kick upper, band 3 ≈ sub_high 60-80 Hz — bass
guitar low/sub-bass crossover). Mel band edges are perceptual, not
linear Hz, so these are approximations tight enough for mixing
decisions ("is energy in the 30 Hz or 60 Hz range?"). Requires FluCoMa
active — omitted with `sub_detail_warning` otherwise.

## `verify_device_health` / `verify_all_devices_health`

**BUG-2026-04-22#19 fix.** `parameter_count` alone can't tell you
whether an AU/VST is alive — plenty of "loaded" plugins return N
params and silence. These tools fire a real test MIDI note and read
the track meter across a window (`get_track_meters(samples=N)` to
dodge the BUG-#7 "left=right=0 while level>0" artifact).

Common dead-device causes (surfaced in the `hint` field when
`alive=False`): (1) plugin waiting for preset/bank selection, (2)
algorithm/envelope configured for zero output, (3) wrong MIDI channel
or velocity curve, (4) dead VST (reinstall). Try opening the device UI
and auditioning manually.

`verify_all_devices_health` (BUG-2026-04-26#1 fix): audio-track
detection uses `has_midi_input`/`has_audio_input` from
`get_session_info` (earlier code checked nonexistent `is_audio_track`/
`type` fields, so detection silently always evaluated False).
Empty-track detection requires a `get_track_info` round-trip per track
because `get_session_info` doesn't embed per-track `devices` arrays.

## `classify_simpler_slices` — classification thresholds

Validated on "Break Ghosts 90 bpm" reference material:
- KICK: sub+low >= 45%, high < 40%
- HAT: high >= 70% AND mid < 25% (thin metal disc = no drum body)
- SNARE: mid >= 25% AND high >= 40% AND peak >= 0.6 (broadband loud)
- ghost: peak < 0.35

**Always run this before programming drum patterns on a sliced break.**
Slice content depends on transient detection order in the source
audio — slice 0 is NOT guaranteed to be a kick. Assuming drum-rack
convention produces wrong grooves that take iterations to diagnose.

File-path resolution order: explicit `file_path` param, then Remote
Script TCP (`get_simpler_file_path` via direct LOM read — most
reliable), then M4L bridge UDP fallback (kept registered for
environments where Remote Script is stale/unavailable; call
`reload_handlers` to refresh without a full restart).

## `add_drum_rack_pad`

**BUG-2026-04-22#1 fix** — this tool closes a gap where
`load_browser_item` replaced the existing chain on repeat calls and
`load_sample_to_simpler` couldn't address nested rack paths. It chains
six steps atomically: locate/auto-detect the Drum Rack, insert a chain,
assign the trigger note, insert an empty Simpler into the chain, native
`replace_sample_native` with nested addressing, Snap=0 hygiene.

## `replace_simpler_sample` / `load_sample_to_simpler`

Prefer `load_browser_item(track, uri)` when the file is browser-indexed
— the M4L bridge's replace path can silently keep the bootstrap
placeholder in some conditions (this is why both tools verify by
reading back the device name post-load and error if the replace didn't
actually take effect).

Nested addressing (`chain_index` + `nested_device_index`) is Live
12.4+ only (BUG-#1, 2026-04-22) — resolves at
`track.devices[device_index].chains[chain_index].devices[nested_device_index or 0]`,
which is how Drum Rack pad-by-pad construction works. The M4L bridge
fallback cannot resolve nested paths; only the native 12.4 path honors
`chain_index`.

`load_sample_to_simpler`'s bootstrap flow (used pre-12.4 or when no
Simpler exists yet): loads a dummy sample via the browser to force
Ableton to create a Simpler, replaces it with the target file, then
runs the same post-load hygiene/verification as `replace_simpler_sample`.

## `simpler_set_warp` / `compressor_set_sidechain` — LOM gap tools

**BUG-A2**: Python's Remote Script ControlSurface API can't reach
Simpler's `warping`/`warp_mode` — they live on the sample child object
(`SimplerDevice.sample.*`) that only Max for Live's JavaScript LiveAPI
can step into. Hence the M4L bridge round-trip.

**BUG-A3**: `compressor_set_sidechain`'s routing properties
(`sidechain_input_routing_type`/`_channel`) aren't in Compressor's
automatable parameter list, but Python's Remote Script reaches them
directly as device properties (same LOM pattern as `set_track_routing`)
— no M4L bridge needed here, unlike the warp case above.
