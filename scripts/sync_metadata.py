    were registered as ``@mcp.tool()`` decorators but the catalog was never
    regenerated. The contract test

    caught the drift in CI — but only AFTER the release commit and a follow-up
    doc-sync had already been pushed, requiring a third commit to unblock CI.

    Putting the regen inside ``--fix`` means the standard release reflex
    (``python3 scripts/sync_metadata.py --fix``) keeps the catalog in lock-step
    with the live registry. No new release-time checklist item to forget.

    Runs the generator as a subprocess so we don't have to deal with
    re-entering ``asyncio.run()`` in the sync_metadata process. The generator
    writes to stdout, we capture it and only rewrite the file when content
    actually changed (avoids spurious mtime churn).

    Order-of-fixes note: this runs AFTER ``fix_tool_count`` because the
    count-fix touches ``docs/manual/tool-catalog.md`` (it's in
