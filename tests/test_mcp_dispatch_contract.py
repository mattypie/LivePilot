"""Contract tests for MCP_TOOLS <-> mcp_dispatch registry.

The async execution router classifies a step as "mcp_tool" when its tool
name is in MCP_TOOLS. It then looks the tool up in the registry built by
build_mcp_dispatch_registry(). If the classifier claims a tool is
executable but the registry has no adapter, every plan step that emits
that tool fails at runtime with a confusing "not registered" error.

These tests enforce:
  * every MCP_TOOLS entry has a registered adapter
  * every registered adapter corresponds to an MCP_TOOLS entry
  * every adapter resolves the real implementation without raising
