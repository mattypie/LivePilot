"""Tests for the livepilot-creative-director skill + concept + affordance packets.

These tests are documentation-level, not runtime integration tests.
They verify:

  1. The creative-director SKILL.md and its 4 references exist and parse
  2. Every concept packet (42 expected: 28 artists + 14 genres) validates
     against the packet schema in livepilot-core/references/concepts/_schema.md
  3. Every affordance packet (20 expected) validates against the schema
     in livepilot-core/references/affordances/_schema.md
  4. Cross-references resolve: concept packets' canonical_genres point at
     real genre YAMLs; canonical_artists point at real artist YAMLs
  5. Concept packets' move_family_bias uses only the 6 canonical families
  6. The creative-director SKILL.md description contains the key triggers
     that make the skill fire on creative intent

Run with:
    python -m pytest tests/test_creative_director.py -v
