"""Regression tests for the lazy/late project-store bind merge.

The bug: ``bind_project_store_from_session`` used to UNCONDITIONALLY reassign
the module-global ``_threads`` and ``_turns`` from disk. When the startup bind
could not reach Ableton (the exact case the lazy bind path exists for), the
tracker accepted ``open_thread`` / ``record_turn_resolution`` with NO store
attached — those entries lived only in memory and were never flushed. The
later bind then discarded them (silent data loss).

These tests pin the fix: a late bind MERGES — in-memory entries absent from
disk survive AND get persisted, while disk stays the truth for ids it holds.
