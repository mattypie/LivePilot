"""Claim-consistency guard.

For every numeric claim in user-facing prose (README, CLAUDE.md, docs/),
we derive the truth from code. If the two disagree, the test fails with
exactly which file + which claim drifted.

Before v1.10.9 each of these drifts shipped at least once in production:
  * manifest.json / server.json advertised stale tool counts because they
    were outside sync_metadata's file list, or used the hyphenated form
    ``323-tool`` that the regex missed.
  * README.md claimed ``81 enriched`` devices when only 71 YAML profiles
    existed; ``7 genre defaults`` when code shipped 4; ``28 bridge
    commands`` when the bridge had 30.
  * docs/manual/intelligence.md pinned the tool count at 323 across
    releases because no one had touched that page.

This test reuses the exact same derivation + check paths that
``scripts/sync_metadata.py --check`` uses, so a green test ≡ a green
sync_metadata run. CI already calls the script directly; this test
makes the guarantee visible from ``pytest`` too, which is what most
contributors run locally.
