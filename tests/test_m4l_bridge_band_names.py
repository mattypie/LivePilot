"""Regression guard for T3 (sub_low band) from the 2026-04-22 handoff.

The M4L analyzer may emit either 8-band or 9-band spectrum payloads
depending on which frozen .amxd the user has loaded. The server side must
handle both without breaking: existing 8-band devices keep their names,
new 9-band devices get the sub_low key prepended.
