"""Tests for generate_branch_seeds_and_plans — the multi-producer entry
point that wires synthesis_brain and composer into Wonder.

Review flagged that propose_synth_branches and propose_composer_branches
were effectively unreachable from the MCP runtime despite being
registered in the conductor. This function fixes that gap.
